<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Most trading sessions start with an overnight gap. Some are real and some are fake.</h4>
<p>News releases and overseas markets impact the open. Some days the gap is small and some days the gap is huge. Sometimes the gap is real and sometimes it is fake. For day trading, our opportunities set up in the first half of the day. To get your bearings as early as possible you need to start your technical analysis before the open. The long term market trend is currently down (2022 D1 basis) so I will write in those terms because it is easier for me to find charts for annotation. The same concepts would apply in reverse if the market was in a long term up trend.</p>
<p>Trading gaps can be a little confusing so let’s start with some terms. When I consider a gap up to be “big”, it has to either open above the prior day’s high or it has to be a 1% move above the close from the prior day. If I consider a gap down to be “big”, it has to open below the prior day’s low or it has to be a 1% drop below the prior close. Any other gap is a small gap. If the market is in a long-term down trend, a gap up is considered to be “contra” because it is going against the longer term trend and a gap down is considered to “agree” because it is aligned with the longer term trend. If the longer term trend is up, a gap down would be “contra” because it is going against the longer term trend and a gap up would “agree”. If a gap up has follow through we consider it to be a “Gap and Go”. It is “going” in the direction of the gap. If a gap up collapses, it is called a “Gap Reversal”. If a gap down has follow through we consider it to be a “Gap and Go” because it is “going” in the direction of the gap. If the market gaps down and then bounces, we call it a “Gap Reversal”. The “big” and “small” definitions and the “agree” and “contra” designations are not industry standards. I assigned them so that the scenarios are easier to describe and concepts are easier to understand. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Big Gap and Go – Agree</h4>
<p>In a bear market, this would be a big gap down and at very least, the high from the gap down day needs to be lower than the low from the prior day (the gap takes out the prior low) or the drop has to be greater than 1% from the prior close. Some gaps are real and they continue in the direction of the gap. This is called a “Gap and Go”. We can expect these when the gap “agrees” with the longer term trend. The market is currently in a long term down trend so we will use this bear market when we reference the trend. If the gap down is large relative to recent gaps, joining the move presents lower risk <strong>once the downward movement is confirmed</strong>. You are joining the longer term trend so the likelihood of a gap reversal is lower compared to the risk of a gap reversal when you are buying a gap up in a bear market (important concept, give this some thought). Shorting large gaps on the open is risky since the gap might be over-extended (fell too far) and some of it could fill right away. Shorts who aggressively short the open risk getting flushed out on bounces. We need to watch the price action to confirm that it is a “Gap and Go” and we do not want to fall victim to a gap reversal (example below in gap reversal section). When the market continues to drop we have technical confirmation and this becomes a high probability short where you can trade larger size. The key is to watch for consecutive red candles and orderly price movement without much retracement on heavy volume. The bounces (if any) should be brief (no more than 30 minutes) and shallow (the open from long red candles remain intact). Because of the big initial drop, most of the drop has already been realized. These large moves lower last about 90 minutes from the open and then the price action compresses. There could be follow through selling later in the day, but the “lion’s share” of the move has already happened. Don’t fret that you missed a good chunk of the move. You needed that technical confirmation before you enter and there is plenty of “meat on the bone”. You can trade larger size at this stage of the move and that will offset some of the price drop you missed. You can also ride these trades longer because the threat of any bounce does not come until very late in the day (last 30 minutes typically).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Big Gap and Go – Contra</h4>
<p>In a bear market, this would be a big gap up where at minimum the low from the gap day is higher than the prior day’s high (gap takes out the prior high) or the move up is more than 1% above the prior close. The market does not go straight down or straight up and news typically causes these large gaps that are contrary to the longer-term trend. As of this writing we are in a bear market (2022). Inflation is running wild and the Fed is hiking rates so fast that they might push the economy into a recession. A large gap up could happen because inflation is starting to ease or from “dovish” Fed statements. The reason for the contra gap does not really matter, the end result is a big gap up that is likely to spark short covering. When we have a big “Gap and Go” against the longer term trend we have to use extra caution. The risk of having the rug pulled out (Gap Reversal) is very high so you do NOT want to buy the open. I have an example of this in the “Gap Reversal” section below. We need to wait for technical confirmation before we take a position. The market is in a longer term down trend so we know that the selling pressure has been heavy. Stacked long green candles consecutively with little to no overlap early in the session on heavy volume will tell us the rally is real. The open on a “Gap and Go” is often the low of the day and the market shoots higher in the first 30 minutes of trading. This is a low reward trade because much of the move will be exhausted by the time we have the technical confirmation we need. When we get these contra formations I trade smaller size and I wait for a pullback later in the day (happens very often). At some point, profit taking will set in. Day traders will be anxious to take gains on longs when they are trading against the longer-term down trend. Longer-term sellers will test the bid (sell orders) when they see resistance forming. If they sense that the bid is fairly strong they will hold off on additional sell orders and they will wait for higher prices. If this dip from the high of the day is relatively small I will look for a day trade on the long side. I want to preserve half of the range between the high today and the open today (not the high today and the prior day’s close) and ideally we stay tight to the high of the day and preserve even more of it. That small retracement tells me that the selling pressure is not organized (no consecutive long red candles) and that for the time being, buyers have control. On any drop, if the bid crumbles and the selling gets organized (nice sized consecutive red candles on volume), we could have a gap reversal setting up. I will discuss this in greater detail later. Just know that in order to trade from the long side on a “Gap and Go Contra”, we have to stay tight to the high of the day. Since I am waiting for a dip later in the day, most of the move has been exhausted. I am also trading smaller size because this is contra to the long term trend. This is not a fantastic trading set up for the reasons I’ve noted, but don’t despair. As you can see in the chart below, they don’t happen often and they typically set up great entry points for shorts where we can join the longer-term down trend.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Small Gap and Go – Agree</h4>
<p>In the context of a bear market, this is a small gap down. These moves agree with the longer term trend and they present a different set of issues and opportunities. The magnitude of the gap is a sign that sellers are not overly aggressive. These gaps can often fill so we need to make sure that sellers are in control. Our best case scenario is a wimpy bounce into the gap with mixed overlapping candles on light volume. That gives us time to evaluate the price action and to find stocks with relative weakness. Ideally, more than half of the gap is preserved. When the bounce stalls we have an excellent entry point for short positions. We know there is selling pressure and we are joining the longer term down trend. Once we have a new low for the day on decent volume, we can short. The market needs to work its way below the prior day’s low and ideally it breaches that support with ease. This is a lower risk trade because we are joining the long term down trend. The potential reward is higher (especially if a D1 support has been breached) because the opening gap was not big. We have plenty of profit potential because the opening move is not over-extended. This back drop sets up nice orderly trading and a steady drift lower. There are times when a small gap down will start with consecutive stacked red candles with little to no overlap on decent volume. This is an excellent set up because it indicates heavy selling and the odds of a bear trend day are high. If you see these stacked red candles in the first 30 minutes of trading you need to get some shorts on. This is a “short stupid” moment. If chasing makes you nervous (and it should), start scaling in and add on weakness. Because the initial gap down was not that big, you have lots of profit potential and a room for the momentum to build and that is why this pattern is better than a Big “Gap and Go Agree”. Watch for stacked red candles an an easy breach of the prior day’s low (sign of heavy selling pressure). Decent volume on the drop will serve as added confirmation. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Small Gap and Go – Contra</h4>
<p>In this pattern we have a small gap higher in a longer term bearish market. We often see these when the previous day had heavy selling and when the market closed on the low of the day. This little gap is an overnight relief rally from over-extended selling. Often the overnight bounce is instantly squashed when sellers return (“Small Gap Reversal Contra”) so don’t assume that a “Gap and Go” is going to happen. First of all we want to preserve half of the gap (Open minus prior day’s close). That would tell us that buyers are engaged and that they are willing to defend the gap. Stacked consecutive green candles on heavy volume would be the ideal scenario. That would tell us that buyers are aggressive and because the gap up is relatively small we have lots of room to run and a chance for momentum to build. This would set up a major short squeeze. Next we want to attack the prior day’s high and we need to get through that first resistance level. Often, the gap up holds and it gradually gains momentum. The move higher will start and stop and sellers are always testing the bid. Remember, this is in the context of a bear market. In the chart below there were not any large pullbacks. This is a sign that buyers are engaged and they will get more aggressive as the day wears on. Shorts will get nervous and they will cover positions. That will create additional buying pressure. This is not a great trading set up because the threat of a “reversal” looms so I trade smaller size. We are trading against the longer term down trend so the price action is going to be jerky. Buyers are constantly looking over their shoulders and the rug could get pulled out at any time. Set passive targets and take gains along the way.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Big Gap Reversal – Agree</h4>
<p>In this pattern the gap down is big and it agrees with the longer-term down trend. Bearish speculators get very excited when they see this and those who have very little patience will short the open. To their surprise, the market reverses and they get the door slammed in their face. This is why we do NOT predict that this is going to be a “Big Gap and Go – Agree”. We have to wait for technical confirmation that sellers are in control. If the opening low holds immediately and the market moves right into the gap, a reversal is possible. The news that caused the gap might not have been that dire. Trading volume in the overnight session is light and buyers simply pulled their bids and waited for the open. This could have caused an over-reaction/air-pocket. When buyers saw the drop, they did not hesitate. The key for a reversal like this is long green candles and heavy volume. We have to see early signs that buyers are interested. Because there was overnight news and because the longer term trend is down, we are going to see overlapping candles on the bounce. We are also likely to see green candles retrace and there will be and dips. These bounces are hard to trade because you are always looking over your shoulder wondering, “Where did all of the sellers go?” The choppy grind higher is also frustrating because the market spends an hour moving higher and those gains can be wiped out in a couple of bars. Watch for a low in the first 30 minutes of trading and a long green candle off of that low. The open of that green candle needs to be preserved. From that point on you want to see a series of higher lows during the day and you want to reach the halfway point of the gap (previous close – today’s open) in the first half of the day. The rally needs to happen on heavy volume. If you have these elements, the reversal has a good chance of happening. At some point the downside is going to be tested. That dip should preserve most of the gains from the low and you want to see a higher low. The temptation for day traders will be to short this dip. They want to join the longer term down trend. They saw the big overnight drop and they are looking for a good entry point for shorts. When the market finds support well above the low it will embolden buyers and they will be active. Shorts will get squeezed and when they cover the next leg higher will unfold. When the gap looks like it has a chance to fill, sellers will cancel offers on the notion that they will be able to sell at a higher price. That also fuels the move. It is more common to see a down gap reversal off of a relative low (60-day low) than it is off of a relative high. At the low end of the range, the market is typically oversold. Buyers feel like there is value at that price level and bears are eager to take gains on short positions. That is what causes these “reversals”.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Big Gap Reversal – Contra</h4>
<p>In this pattern the big gap up goes against the longer term down trend (contra). These happen when there is big news and there has to be a “surprise” component that catches the market off guard. Are institutions going to support the move or fade it? In the chart below a favorable CPI just before an FOMC statement excited buyers. Inflation had been forcing the Fed to tighten and this “better than feared” inflation number had the potential to prompt the Fed to take their foot off of the brake. That was the rationale behind the spike and it really does not matter what caused the spike. I just thought this information would add some “color”. We just had to watch the price action. The first candle of the day was red and the next few candles could not get back to the opening price (the high of the day). The high touched the 1-year downward sloping trendline. In the first 30 minutes of trading we had a new low of the day and the SPY was not close to getting back to the high of the day. The red candles were starting to mount and the volume was extremely heavy. At this stage, a “Big Gap Reversal – Contra” looked likely. It is unusual to see a monster gap up like this fail, but remember we are in a bear market. A move of this magnitude would certainly attract long-term short sellers and shorter-term bulls would be tempted to take profits on longs. If the move held the opening price (bullish), shorts would be running for cover and longer term Asset Managers would start “believing” (buying). Sellers had control and they got more confident when the 200-day MA was tested and it failed. “Big Gap Reversal – Contra” set-ups have incredible profit potential once there is technical confirmation. Watch for a high of the day in the first few bars, long red candles with heavy volume and a series of new lows. Once the high of the day is in, we do not want any long green candles that test it. Since the reversal joins the longer term down trend our odds of success are relatively high and we can trade larger size. These trades have lots of room to drop and the momentum builds during the day. If there are key technical levels that fail on the way down, the selling pressure will build. Once half of the gap fills, buyers pull bids and the drop accelerates. These are fantastic trend days so you want to ride your day trading shorts as long as possible. We tend to see this pattern at the extremes of a range. That is where buyers and sellers are most active. If this gap reversal is at a relative high, we can expect follow through selling pressure the next week. This is a clear sign of resistance and it will not go unnoticed.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Small Gap Reversal – Agree</h4>
<p>In the context of a longer-term down trend, the market has a small gap down that agrees with the longer term trend. This seems like a good set-up on the open and it could turn into a “Small Gap and Go – Agree”, but we have to wait. As the price action unfolds, the market finds support and the gap is reversed. Because the gap down was relatively small, sellers are not that aggressive. The first six bars will tell us if this gap is going to “reverse” or “go”. Consecutive green candles are a sign that the gap could easily reverse. This is particularly true if the mid-point of the gap (prior close – open today) is reached or if the low from the prior day is reached. Nice volume with long green candles would suggest that the gap will easily fill. Often, the candles will be mixed and institutions will try both sides to see if they can get something going. There are times when the market will probe a little deeper after the open, but the candles are mixed and overlapping indicating a weak move lower. There are also times when that probe deeper has tiny bodied candles. This is also a sign of support. The longer the market sits near the opening price, the more likely it is to bounce. Buyers have defended the low and a “Gap and Go” (lower) has been avoided. The scenario in the chart below is not ideal because the gap did not take out the prior day’s low. It did test it and when it did so two bullish hammers were a sign of support. The long green candle off of the low filled the gap and it was a sign of strength. During the prior 5 trading sessions the S&amp;P 500 had lost 10%. The long green candles and off-setting long red candles came on heavy volume. Buyers and sellers were going to battle it out and we had to expect volatile conditions. The retracement (dip) was big, but the market did find support above the low of the day (higher low) and it finished well off of the low. At very least, short-term support was forming. The selling pressure had been heavy and this little gap down looked like it could gain traction, but it didn’t. It is critically important to patiently wait for the action to unfold. The backdrop looked much different after an hour of trading than it did on the open.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Small Gap Reversal – Contra</h4>
<p>In this pattern we have a small gap up against the longer term down trend hence the designation “contra”. This pattern is common when the selling pressure has been heavy the previous day. Often buyers will test the waters to see if the previous move was over-extended. This little bounce gives us a chance to gauge the selling pressure. Ideally the gap up continues a little higher with mixed overlapping candles and light volume, but we don’t want the move to last more than 30 minutes. The longer it lasts and the higher it goes, the greater the buying pressure. We want that bounce to stall with tiny bodied candles or a bearish engulf or a bearish hammer at the high of the day. That will tell us that sellers have returned and we can prepare to short. If the opening gap higher has consecutive red candles and more than half of the gap is filled, a gap reversal is likely. Red candles and heavy volume are the keys to filling the gap and we want to see them in the first hour of trading. If the open has been preserved during the first hour of trading, a gap reversal is unlikely. That is a sign that buyers are engaged. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">When you see an overnight gap, here are the questions you need to address:</h4>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Is the market in a long-term uptrend?</h6>
<p>The trend is our friend and we always want to join it. A gap up will move in the direction of the trend, but we can’t assume that it is going to be a “Gap and Go”. We like the fact that buyers are engaged and our best case scenario is a small retracement into the gap that finds instant support. That buys us time to evaluate the price action. Stacked consecutive green candles on the open will force us to take action earlier and much of the move will be exhausted by the time we enter. An overnight gap lower is better in a bull market since we have the chance for a “gap reversal’ with lots of upside potential and a chance for a bullish trend day where we can join the longer-term up trend. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Is the market in a long-term downtrend?</h6>
<p>If it is, a gap up is a day trader’s friend. That bounce will help us gauge the selling pressure and it could lead to an excellent entry point for shorts if a “reversal” forms. We have to watch for signs of early resistance (bearish hammers, bearish engulfing candle) and we want to start filling some of the gap in the first hour of trading. If the overnight gap is down, we need to confirm the selling pressure. Long red candles to start the day would indicate a down “Gap and Go” and we might have to “short stupid”. This forces us to take action early in the day and to chase. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Did the gap take out the prior day’s range?</h6>
<p>For big gaps, that is the minimum requirement. A big gap up needs to trade above the prior day’s high and a big gap down needs to trade below the prior day’s low. What was the prior day’s range? If the market was in a tight trading range, eclipsing the high (or the low) is not that difficult. The prior day’s high and low are relevant because that is resistance and support respectively. If the market had a big range the previous day and it closed on its low, a gap up is not likely to take out the prior day’s high. If it does, it had to travel far to do that and it is significant. When the previous day had a huge range and the gap (up or down) is in that range, it is less significant because this is likely to be an “inside day”. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Is the gap going to violate a major moving average?</h6>
<p>Before the open, we know the indication of where the market is likely to start the day. Is that level going to violate any major D1 moving averages? Is it going to be close to any of them? This is critical information. For instance, if the S&amp;P 500 is in a long-term down trend and it closed above the 100-day MA, a gap down to it the next day is important. If that support fails, the selling pressure will mount and we could see a bearish trend day. You need to know where that support level is and you need to monitor it during the trading day. </p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Is the gap up going to challenge a major down trendline?</h6>
<p>Evaluate how close the gap up will be to that trendline and plan around it. That could either spark a breakout and we could have a “Gap and Go” with stacked green candles, or we could have a “Gap Reversal” when resistance at the down trendline is confirmed. In this instance, we had a gap reversal. You were aware of that key price level and you planned for this scenario.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Is the gap down going to breach or touch a major up trendline?</h6>
<p>If it is, you can plan for either scenario. A bounce off of that upward sloping trendline could set up a “Gap Reversal” and we know to watch for stacked green candles that easily move to the middle of the gap early in the day. If the up trendline fails, we know we could have a “Gap and Go” to the downside that results in a bearish trend day. That would tell us that we can ride our short positions because the longer-term market trend is down. In the chart below the market had just closed below the 200-day MA the day before. Follow through selling would send it through the upward sloping trendline and we could see a “Gap and Go” bearish trend day. That scenario seemed very likely and we could plan for it. </p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">What has the recent price action been like?</h6>
<p>Does the gap agree or disagree with the trend? The strength of the trend is going to increase the chances of a “Gap and Go” or a “Gap Reversal”. Is the market trapped in a range with tiny candles and light volume? In the chart below I have highlighted a period like this. These gaps were happening inside of a horizontal compression and they had little meaning. Most of those days the market did not move much. We know that from the tiny bodied candles and the wicks and tails. Did the gap happen near a relative high or a relative low? We know those areas will attract buyers and sellers and the moves can be large. At relative highs we can see up gap “reversals” and they are a sign of resistance. We can expect follow through selling when we see long red candles at a relative high and we can expect some bearish “Gap and Go’s” after that. I highlighted some of those in the chart below. At relative lows we can see down gap “reversals” that indicate support and we can expect the bounce to continue with some “Gap and Go” rallies. Are we seeing long mixed candles on the daily chart with good volume? This is a sign of volatility and we can expect big moves in both directions. That means the gaps could “go” or “reverse”. We need to use caution and we need to confirm which pattern is forming.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">What is the status of 1OP on the open?</h6>
<p>I will discuss day trading with 1OP in greater detail in another section, but it helps us gauge the buying and selling pressure early in the day. If we have a gap down and 1OP is in a bullish cycle, we should see if the market bounces during that bullish cycle and if it fills in some of the gap. If it does not, we know the selling pressure is heavy and that the bearish cross will set up a great entry for a likely “Gap and Go”. If 1OP is in a bearish cycle and we get a massive gap up, we should watch for selling. If we see stacked red candles during the bear cycle we know that the chances of a “Gap Reversal” are high. I’ve highlighted charts with each of these scenarios below. </p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">How big is the gap and why is that important?</h6>
<p>Big gaps up open well above the prior day’s high and big gaps down open below the prior day’s low. These are the first resistance/support levels that the market has to get through each day and if it can’t do that, the gap is less significant. A gap of more than 1% would also qualify as a big gap. A move of this magnitude will often reach other longer-term technical levels. What happens at those levels determines the direction and once we have technical confirmation, our odds of success improve dramatically. Smaller gaps to a technical support/resistance level can turn into trend days. This happens when there has been a recent trend to that level. Because the gap is relatively small, it can gain momentum when that level is breached and that leads to a trend day with nice consistent price action (because the gap was small the move is not over-extended). If the gap is small and it can’t get through the prior day’s range, it is of little significance and it is likely to reverse. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Was the market able to recover half of the gap?</h6>
<p>When we measure the gap we use the previous closing price and the opening price today. If more than half of the gap is recovered, the chances of a “Gap Reversal” are much higher. It is a sign that the initial move was an over-reaction. If the mid-point is preserved, the chances of a “Gap and Go” increase. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Was the opening price the high/low of the day?</h6>
<p>If the market gaps up and the opening price is the low of the day, we often see stacked green candles and we know that a “Gap and Go” is likely. If the market gaps up and the opening price was the high of the day, we often start with stacked long red candles and the odds of a “Gap Reversal” increase. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">What is the price action like in the first 30 minutes?</h6>
<p>A wimpy attempt to fill the gap has mixed overlapping candles on light volume. If more than half of the gap is preserved, this move is likely to fail and the market will move in the direction of the gap. This could quickly turn into a “Gap and Go” and that small move gave us valuable time to gauge the price action and to enter at a good price. We were able to confirm that the initial direction of the gap was correct. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Which scenario is going to play out?</h6>
<p>Is this going to be a “Gap and Go” or a “Gap Reversal”? What is the best scenario? What is the most likely scenario? How will I trade it? What signs should I look for? I’ve already covered much of this , but it always helps to have fresh examples. Scenario analysis is a process that you should go through before each open. Know the context and visualize what might happen. Plan your actions around these outcomes so that you are ready to execute. I will create a separate section called Gap Scenario Analysis where I can post various examples as they set-up. It is important for you to conduct scenario analysis before the open each day so that you can be proactive instead of reactive.</p>
<p>This has become a very long article. Gaps are complicated and significant. They are filled with traps and opportunities. I’ve been reluctant to write this article because I knew that it was going to take a lot of planning. I highlighted 8 different set-ups in the context of a long term market downtrend. Know that there are 8 different set-ups for a long term up trend. The concepts are the same. I will continue to add to this section over time to fill in any gaps (pun intended).</p>
