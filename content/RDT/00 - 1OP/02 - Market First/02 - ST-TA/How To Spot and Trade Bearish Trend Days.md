<h4 class="wp-block-heading">These are some of the most profitable set-ups so it is important to identify them early.</h4>
<p>I am often asked, “How do I know when to let my profits run and when to set passive targets?” Market context has a huge impact on your trading game plan and it dictates when you should be entering and exiting trades. When the market is trapped inside of the prior day’s range (“Inside Day”) or it is trapped inside of the first hour range with choppy price action, you should set passive targets. When the market has a trend day, you approach it differently and you can let your trades run. In addition to this article I recorded a video this morning.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPfWxS12yUY" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Click here</a>&nbsp;to watch it.</p>
<p>Here’s how to identify a trend day. The market is currently in a longer term bear trend and we have a bearish trend day so let’s focus on that set up. A bearish trend day will have at least 3 long stacked red candles with little to no overlap on heavy volume. They can come off of a up gap reversal (really great set-up) or a down “Gap and Go” (not as attractive). Those candles need to come in the first 45 minutes of trading and they are a sign of aggressive selling.</p>
<p>Why is an up gap reversal better than a down “gap and go”? In a down “gap and go” much of the downside has been realized so the move lower is likely to be choppier and the bounces tend to be bigger. If you are nervous about shorting these moves, don’t worry. Be patient and you will get your chance. In “Gap and Go” bearish trend days a great short will come when a bounce looks legitimate. You want bearish speculators to regret not taking gains near the low of the day as the market is bouncing. They start lamenting about the money they could have made and they take gains on shorts while they still have them. Bullish speculators get excited because they see lots of upside and limited downside because support is nearby. They start to pile in on an M5 trendline breach to the upside or a rally above the VWAP. “Will you walk into my parlor?” said the spider to the fly. The more real this bounce looks, the more attractive this shorting opportunity becomes. When those bullish speculators get flushed out they will create selling pressure and they will fuel the next leg lower. For those of you who do not like to chase “Gap and Go” patterns, this is your opportunity!</p>

<p>In an up gap reversal there is lots of room on the downside and the momentum builds very quickly. The price action is very orderly because there is plenty of room on the downside. The bounces only last 10-15 minutes and you want to stick with your positions as long as possible. The red candles are longer and more plentiful so it is easy to stick with the position. Don’t cover until you hit a major support level or until you see a bullish hammer off of the low of the day or a long bullish engulfing candle off of the low of the day.</p>

<p>Let’s talk a little about the mental mindset for these days and the notion of being able to let trades “run”.</p>
<p>An up gap reversal that agrees with the longer term bearish trend is easy so let’s start there. The downside is incredible. Once the opening price and the low of the day (sometimes they are the same) are breached, we can expect that some of the up gap will be filled. If we do NOT have stacked red candles consecutively in the first 30 minutes, it might not be a gap reversal. Mixed overlapping candles and tiny bodies are a sign of support and the gap might not fill. Only stacked consecutive candles on heavy volume will do. Once that selling pressure starts, the momentum builds quickly. The drop accelerates as bullish speculators who bought the opening bounce are flushed out. The bounces are brief and shallow so these moves are easy to ride. There are very few if any “gut checks” along the way.</p>
<p>A down “Gap and Go” in a longer term bear trend is also a great pattern, but it is a little trickier because the market has already dropped considerably and there is less downside potential. Again, we need those consecutive stacked long red candles with little to no overlap very early in the day. Seasoned traders who know this pattern can “short stupid” knowing that there is more downside. Most novice traders will not have the “guts” to and they will probably give into temptation and short near the low of the day. They will get FOMO and they will regret not pulling the trigger earlier. They missed a great opportunity in their eyes. In the early going, they will wait for the bounce that never comes and then they will eventually cave in. If this sounds familiar and you are a “Nervous Nellie”, don’t trade early in the day.</p>
<p>The “Nervous Nellie” is typically a novice trader who is undercapitalized/overleveraged and who has a marginal win rate. They take a position and they have no confidence in their skills. They want desperately to hit a home run and they promise themselves that they are going to ride the trade out. This time they had the nerve to “short stupid” after they saw those stacked red candles. On the bounce they keep ringing their hands and they think about what could have been if they had just exited on the low of the day. As the market rallies and their position still has a tiny gain they puke it. Then the S&amp;P 500 starts to slip lower and it falls apart. They don’t have the “nerve” to get back in so they miss the move lower. My advice to these traders (if they get in on the initial move lower) is to take gains when they see a bullish hammer/bullish engulfing candle off of the low of the day or if the candles bodies are small. Is this the ultimate exit? No. These are signs of support and we are talking about “Nervous Nellies”.</p>
<p>Better advice for these traders is two-fold. Let the first wave of selling run its course and do not fret that you missed a great move. Convince yourself that you will get another chance to short. My second word of advice is that by no means should you consider buying dips NO MATTER HOW GOOD THEY LOOK. You are either short or in cash on bearish trend days. When you spot resistance during the bounce (tiny bodied candles, tall wicks, bearish hammers, bearish engulfing candles or a broken M5 up trendline), take the short with confidence knowing that the low of the day is NOT in. Even if you did not enter perfectly, you will have a chance to exit for a gain. When you patiently wait for your short to set up you are able to gather information and to watch the price action.</p>
<p>The second type of trader has “nerves of steel” and a ton of confidence. They recognize that this move is going to continue and that this is a bearish trend day. The market has a nice technical breakdown and stacked red candles. They know that if they get “cute” and close all of the short positions early, they will have to time the re-entry and they might miss a bigger move lower. A large number of short positions make it harder to get in and out. They know how much heat they are willing to take and they will add to positions on the bounce knowing that “the low of the day is not in”. They will ride the trades hard and long because they are confident. They are well capitalized and they have a good win rate so they are not sweating bounces. These are the two extremes and most of you fall somewhere in between.</p>
<p>With an hour of trading left today, here is how the action played out on October 7th.</p>
