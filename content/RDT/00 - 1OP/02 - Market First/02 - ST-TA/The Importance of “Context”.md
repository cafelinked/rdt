<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There’s a reason this is one of the first articles in the Short-Term Market Analysis section. You need to understand how today’s puzzle piece fits into the big picture.</h4>
<p>To this point, all of the analysis has focused on longer term fundamental and technical analysis. They provide the framework for what is happening today and your longer term analysis will provide important clues that will help you plan for the current day. Every trading day is different because the context changes constantly. Members often ask questions that include the words “always”, “never”, “typically”, and “usually”. Those questions can’t be answered without a detailed description of the context.</p>
<p>Let me provide an example. “Do you <em>always </em>short /ES when it has gapped up on the open and then drops below the low of the day?” I can’t answer that question without knowing the context and I would need more information.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Was the market in a longer term down trend?</li>
<li>Did the gap penetrate major resistance?</li>
<li>Did the market breach major technical support the day before?</li>
<li>What was the price action like the day before?</li>
<li>Did this gap happen on heavy volume?</li>
<li>Did the open fail immediately?</li>
<li>Were the candles mixed and overlapping or stacked?</li>
<li>How big was the gap?</li>
<li>Was 1OP M5 in a bearish cycle?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a sampling of some of the considerations that would go into deciding if I should short what could be a gap reversal. Here are some contextual considerations that are often overlooked.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Major Earnings Releases</h4>
<p>AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, META, TSLA are some of the largest market capitalization companies in the world and they comprise more than 25% of the S&amp;P 500 value. These announcements will impact the market. As of this writing, the market has a tendency to rally two weeks into these releases because optimism builds. This condition could change in the future, but this information provides context. Currently, JPM (JP Morgan Chase) is considered the first company to report so you can use it to determine when earnings season starts. If we are days out from these announcements, we know that the market bid should remain firm and that will help us plan our short term trades. At very least, it means a big market drop is unlikely. That information has value!</p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pending News Releases</h4>
<p>Pending news releases often result in dull trading the day before. Traders will wait for the release and they will reduce their exposure into the news. The Unemployment Report and the FOMC statement are two examples. This information tells us to keep our trading light and to set passive day trading targets. On a swing basis, it means that we need to reduce risk because the reaction could produce a big market move.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Big Moves the Prior Day</h4>
<p>Big moves the prior day often result in a dull trading session the next day. Traders are digesting the move and determining if it is legitimate. Buyers and sellers are often paired off the next day. If the big move the prior day was to the upside and the market gaps down slightly the next day (profit taking) we should expect that there will be decent support and that at some point buyers will test the upside. We should not expect a massive follow through rally because that pattern does not happen very often (note: consecutive big rallies are more likely off of a relative low vs a relative high). If we get a second rally, it confirms strength in that direction. We don’t guess that follow through will happen, we watch for stacked consecutive candles on heavy volume for confirmation. We operate under the premise that it is NOT going to happen and that trading will be relatively quiet. In a daily chart of the SPY, find those long candles and see what has happened the next day. This will provide you with context. </p>

<p>Key moves the previous day could include gap reversals, breakouts through support/resistance or rejections off of support/resistance. Those moves indicate buying/selling and they will set the tone for the next day. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Major Moving Averages &amp; Longer Term Trendlines</h4>
<p>When major moving averages and longer term trendlines can be reached during the day, they will act as magnets. We need to be aware of these price levels because they will impact trading. If they are going to be breached, we want to aggressively test them during the day on heavy volume and we want “escape velocity” right away. If we get that, the momentum will build after the breakout and we can expect a trend day. If those levels are stubborn with tiny little attempts at a breakout that quickly fail, a reversal is likely. Traders need to be aware of these levels because they lend context to what is going to happen during the day.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Triple Witching</h4>
<p>Triple witching happens on the third Friday in March, June, September and December. Futures and options expiration often produces a day or two of big moves as institutional traders “unwind/roll” positions. The likelihood of a trend day also increases ahead of a triple witch. Once the momentum is established, trading programs take advantage of that intraday strength and they “unwind/roll” positions. This process fuels the move. If you understand that this could happen you can watch for it.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Beginning &amp; End of the Month</h4>
<p>The last few days of the month and the first few days of the month, historically, have a bullish bias. This is when Asset Managers allocate funds based on expected inflows. Social Security checks are cut and some of that money flows into the market. Funds also rebalance at the end of the month. Many have a percentage of assets allocated to equities and to bonds. If one asset class rallies and the other drops, they have to sell one and buy the other to keep the percentages in line. This context tells you that the last few days of the month and the first few days are not like the others. As you can see in the chart below, this pattern has not been as prominent recently, but we are in a bear market.</p>

                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/context-end-of-month-1024x632.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="41553a44-b805-4502-8e38-84d976cca207">

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Seasonal Patterns</h4>
<p>Seasonal patterns are powerful. I have a trading axiom that I never swing short in November and December. Those are historically two of the strongest months of the year. Asset Managers get paid on assets under management and the greater the value, the more they get paid. This provides a disincentive for them to sell stocks. September is historically one of the weakest months of the year. The Fed and politicians are in recess and the market gets nervous when no one is “minding shop”. August is typically one of the slowest months of the year. Traders take time off before their kids go back to school. These seasonal tendencies provide us with context and they will impact your short term trading. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>The day before and the day after a holiday, expect dull trading conditions. Often, the two days before and the two days after are lackluster. When you see a holiday approaching, you should trade smaller size and expect compressed intraday trading ranges.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Volume</h4>
<p>Volume is also critically important. Above average volume legitimizes the current move because we know institutions are participating. Heavy volume declines with light volume bounces would indicate selling pressure. Heavy volume rallies with light volume drops indicate buying pressure. If the volume is below average, the chances of a strong directional trend are less likely. Under these conditions we should expect sideways price action. If the market happens to trend on light volume, we should understand that these moves can easily be reversed.</p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Inside Days</h4>
<p>When the market can’t get above the prior day’s high or the prior day’s low, we call that an “inside day”. Those two levels represent resistance and support respectively and they are a sign that the action is going to be dull, compressed and choppy. Mixed overlapping candles and low volume are likely and this context needs to be part of your day trading game plan. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Price Action</h4>
<p>The price action during the day also has to be taken into account. Long consecutive candles of a single color are a sign of trend strength. Dojis are a sign of equilibrium and dull trading. Long candles that reverse instantly on good volume are a sign of volatility and so are offsetting candles with long tails/wicks. Mixed overlapping candles with small bodies are a sign of choppy trading. These candlestick patterns are important on a daily chart and an intraday chart. They tell us what to expect. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>Knowing the market context means that you are aware of your surrounding conditions. Longer-term factors are taken into consideration along with important price levels and recent price action. You need to incorporate these variables into your trading game plan. Set expectations for the current day based on context. Conduct scenario analysis based on this information and know which scenarios are most likely and which ones would be most favorable from a trading standpoint. When you do this, you will have clarity. As the day unfolds, you will understand how this puzzle piece fits into the big picture and you will be ready to execute your game plan. Moves that previously seemed random will all of a sudden make sense because you are looking for them and you understand the forces that are “in play”. </p>
