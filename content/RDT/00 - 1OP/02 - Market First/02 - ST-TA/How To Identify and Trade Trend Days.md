<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Trend days are high probability set-ups so size up and be aggressive. Trade a few dozen of these successfully and you will hit your goals for the year </h4>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes day traders make is that they treat each day the same. They use the same trade size and the same mechanical stops regardless of market conditions. This leads to age old questions like, “How can I improve my exits?” and “Should I take gains now or let it run?” Market price action determines when we should take gains. When we are presented with trend days, we have an opportunity to ride the momentum for oversized gains. You will have to train yourself on how to do this because the temptation to exit early will be strong. Here are the keys to identifying trend days. </p>
<p>Trend days are like flying a jet from LA to New York. The speed and distance traveled tell us we are on a direct, non-stop flight. Trend days feature fast price movement and they cover a lot of distance in a short period of time. This makes it much easier for us to predict price movement so these are high probability set-ups. <strong><em>Long consecutive candles of a single color with little to no overlap on heavy volume are the key.</em></strong> This pattern is a sign that institutions are extremely aggressive. Since we are talking about intraday price action, we won’t concern ourselves with why the move is taking place. It could be part a strong longer term trend, it could be a trend reversal, a technical breakout or it could be news related. </p>

<p>These stacked red candles are not an accident and they are unusual. The normal price action that we see has many overlapping candles with retracement and the colors are mixed. When we do not see that and when the bodies of the candles are above average in length, it is a sign that institutions are hitting every bid they can find. The bounces will last less than 30 minutes and the height of the retracements will leave the half-way point of the last long red candle intact. </p>
<p>Here’s the problem. Most traders have been taught to, “Be patient and wait for a better entry point.” They will look at that pattern of stacked red candles and they will wait for the bounce that never comes. In this exact price pattern (accept no substitutes) you will have to act quickly. You are not going to get a bounce. If you find yourself in this situation and you are paralyzed, take a small position with the intentions of adding to your winner or adding at a better price. In time you will gain the confidence you need to take a larger trade and you will hone your skills in identifying this pattern early. </p>
<p>Another mistake that traders make is that they get giddy with the money they made and they will take gains prematurely. In a normal market with normal patterns, this is prudent, but not when you have stacked candles of a single color on heavy volume and not when the pattern is less than an hour old. You will convince yourself that you will take gains and enter better on the next bounce. The market bounces and while you are looking for signs that the bounce is running out of steam, the bottom will fall out and you will re-enter at a worse level than if you stuck with the original trade. </p>
<p>By all means, don’t be the fool who tries to predict a bounce. “This drop is so big there is no way it is going to hold!” That is a great way to blow up an account. This move is real and it is going to continue. This pattern is the start of a trend day!</p>
<p>Given the slant of this article, you will be trying to find stacked candles everywhere, and you should. Just know how to spot the “real deal”. Look Pete! Stacked candles! The chart below is NOT the pattern. The candles are of a single color and that is good. This is tradeable, but you have to temper your expectations. This move is not going to have legs. The tails/wicks are long, the candle bodies are small, we only have one long candle, there is a lot of retracement and the volume is light. </p>

<p>When we have the pattern of at least 3 consecutive longer than average candles of the same color with small tails/wicks and little retracement on heavy volume we are going to have a trend day. I am going to focus on the short side because I have a couple of recent examples, but the same principle applies to the long side. Early in the day (after a series of stacked candles) you will see tiny bounces that last less than 30 minutes. The bounces are just traders taking gains on shorts and some fools trying to predict a bottom. Institutions pound these bids and when dip buyers bail out for a loss, they spark even more selling. “Prudent” traders who took gains on their shorts scramble to re-establish the short and that also fuels the move lower. Typically, the first bounce will last 20 minutes. Sellers are aggressive and they will play “whack-a-mole” with buyers. The next drop will be decent. This sets up a series of mini bear flag formations and you will typically get a few of these. As the day progresses the new lows will be marginal (smaller than the last drop) and the bounces will be longer in duration and greater in height. This is a sign that support is starting to form. </p>
<p>Know that every day is different and that it is difficult to generalize. If you learn to read price action, you will be able to determine direction without a list of different formations. This is an example of a bearish trend day that found early support. In the chart below you will notice that the first bounce lasted much longer than 30 minutes and the height was good. That tells us that there is support near the low of the day. You will also notice that the next low of the day was a marginal new low. There were bullish engulfing candles on the low of the day and this is a sign that buyers are defending that level. These are signs that support is building and that the selling pressure is subsiding.</p>

<p>A bearish trend day will take out the prior day low on heavy volume. You will see at least 3 consecutive red candles that are longer than average and that stack one on top of the other. The tails/wicks will be small and the candle will open near its high for the bar and close near its low for the bar. It is common for the momentum to breach major D1 trendlines, moving averages and horizontal support levels. Those breakdowns fuel the move and traders who try to fade it will lose money. Join these moves early . If you just can’t handle it mentally, start with small size. These candles do not lie. As the move unfolds, evaluate the bounces. You want to see brief shallow bounces and substantial new lows. Towards the end of the day the momentum will wane. It is common that the market will not have a decent bounce on bearish trend days until the last 30 minutes of trading when shorts take profits. </p>
<p>One final note on trend days. Gap reversals (another article) provide a much better profit profile than “Gap and Go” formations. When the market gaps up and then reverses, there is plenty of momentum and lots of room to drop and those red candles have plenty of time to stack. When the market gaps down and then stacks candles (“Gap and Go”), much of the move has already been made. Use more caution when the gap down is big vs a small gap down. This should be common sense. </p>
<p>Use the opposite guidelines for bullish trend days.</p>
<p>This is the most reliable and profitable day trading pattern I have found. Here is a classic example of a powerful bearish trend day. </p>
