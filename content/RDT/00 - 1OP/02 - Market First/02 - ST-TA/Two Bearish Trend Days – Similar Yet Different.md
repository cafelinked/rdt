<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Every trading day is different. Learn to read price action and you will know what to do.</h4>
<p>Every trading day is different and that is why I try not to generalize. The backdrop for this day can be seen in the lower left hand part of the image. This is a D1 view and the larger chart is the M5 timeframe. The market was rejected at the 200-day MA and it had broken a steep D1 up trendline. We were in a holding pattern and traders were waiting for “Fed Speak” at a conference in Jackson Hole. Before the speech, the market could have gone either way. A bullish reaction could have resulted in a D1 bullish flag formation and a negative reaction would have resulted in a lower high double top. </p>
<p>As you can see from the big chart below, the reaction was negative. The S&amp;P 500 stacked consecutive long red candles with little overlap on extremely heavy volume. This was a high probability set up and it was time to short!</p>
<p>The market blew through the prior day’s low on those red candles. Most traders are caught flat footed when they see moves like this. They don’t have the confidence to join a move of this magnitude when it seems so late. Late is a relative term. It might seem late at that juncture, but when you look back at the day, you realize that it was early in the move. As the selling pressure accelerated traders had to resist the temptation to take big gains. We are trained to lock in gains because we expect bounces and retracements. That type of price action is normal and profit taking is a prudent practice. However, this was not a normal day. We don’t usually see selling pressure that is this heavy. As the day progressed there was not even one “solo” short covering candle. Those are common during most market declines, but the market couldn’t get off the deck. The bounces had no lift and they were simply pauses. </p>
<p>When you see this level of selling pressure, know that the bid is drying up and there are no buyers. Ride your short positions as long as you can and remove any positions with long exposure. The market is going lower and this could be the start of a longer term trend reversal. As the day progressed, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 3% and it took out the 100-day MA. </p>
<p>There is a hidden danger to trend days like this. Traders will look back and think, “I could have made a fortune if I had just stayed short all day instead of getting in and out.” That is correct, but days like these are rare and you will try to convince yourself otherwise. Don’t focus on the price action from previous trend days, focus on what is in front of you. The stacked red candles were the first clue and the lack of any bounce was the second. The only thing that can prompt this level of selling is a “surprise” that catches institutions off guard. They are pounding bids and unwinding positions to adjust for the event. In this case, it was extremely hawkish Fed comments. They said that they are going to keep tightening to combat inflation, even if it results in an economic down turn. </p>

<p>After a one-day pause, the market stayed below the 100-day MA and it preserved all of the losses from the big drop. An early gap up set the table for a gap reversal and we were ready for it. We were watching for stacked red candles on the open and we got it. In an instant the gap was filled and we took out the prior day’s low on heavy volume. </p>
<p>A D1 trend reversal was confirmed Friday and a gap reversal on this day would give us an excellent entry point to join that down trend. The candles were red and they were long, but there was more overlap. Traders remembered the drop Friday and they would try to ride this move as long as possible. This was a bearish trend day and that was the right thing to do. However, the first bounce was substantial. It retraced a good portion of the drop and it lasted almost two hours. Traders who held short positions through that bounce should have taken comfort knowing that the low of the day was likely to be tested again. On that retest, it would have been prudent to exit at the low of the day. The price action was telling us that support was forming.</p>
<p>When the market dropped later in the day it made a marginal new low (barely took out the prior low of the day). Then we saw a bullish engulfing candle on the low of the day. You will also notice that there were not any bearish divergences (1OP). These are all signs of support. It was likely that the low of the day was in after that retest and we were likely to see another bounce. In the chart below you can see the play-by-play market comments. </p>

<p>Bullish and bearish trend days present high probability trading opportunities, but they are all different. The selling pressure Friday was exceptional and unusual. There were no bounces and this was a news driven drop that caught institutions off guard. When you learn to read price action you do not have to memorize patterns. The duration and height of the bounces along with the depth of the new lows will provide you with valuable information. When you see stacked consecutive candles of a single color like this on heavy volume, join the trend as early as possible and stay the course. If you get a big early bounce like the one above, stay firm in your belief and take gains the next time the low of the day is tested. If you get shallow and brief bounces instead, you will be glad you stayed the course.</p>
