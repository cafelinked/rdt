<h4 class="wp-block-heading">This indicator is not like any other, that’s what makes it so special.</h4>
<p><strong>1OP</strong> stands for <strong>1OP</strong>tion. It is an indicator I spent many years developing and I don’t talk about what makes it tick. It was optimized for day trading /ES and it works best on a five-minute chart (M5). It can be used for other time frames and it works for stock, but I suggest mastering it for SPY M5 first. It does not behave like other indicators and it does require interpretation.</p>
<p>When I was developing 1OP, I tried to “tame” it so that it would act like more traditional indicators. Then, I realized there were benefits to letting it do its own thing. The fact that 1OP does not always correlate with the market provides us with valuable information. My advice is not to draw general conclusions about 1OP. It will act differently from day-to-day and even during the day. Here are some of the characteristics you need to be aware of.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Crosses">Crosses</h2>
<p>When 1OP is greater than zero and 1OP2 (default red line) crosses 1OP1 (default blue line), we have a bearish cross. When 1OP is less than zero and 1OP2 (default red line) crosses 1OP1 (default blue line) we have a bullish cross. We want the troughs to be deep relative to recent troughs, and we want 1OP1 to cross with good separation. Tall spikes relative to other spikes are preferred and when 1OP2 crosses 1OP1, we want nice separation. We don’t often get this pattern, but it is good to know what the ideal set-up looks like. Again, don’t think in absolutes, I can show you scores of bullish and bearish crosses that resulted in great opportunities where the troughs were not deep and the peaks were not very tall.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Bullish_Bearish_Cycles">Bullish &amp; Bearish Cycles</h2>
<p>When 1OP is above zero and we have a bearish cross, a bearish cycle begins. We do not consider it to be over until 1OP drops below zero and then has a bullish cross. This ends the bearish cycle and it starts the bullish cycle. When I annotate M5 charts, I shade the areas of the chart pink for bearish and green for bullish so that you can see what happened during the cycle. Although rare, there are entire days when we are in one cycle and others where we might have 5-6 cycles. Multiple 1OP crosses (1OP2 moves above and below 1OP1) during the same cycle are also not desired. We prefer to see one nice crisp bearish cross with separation at the start of the cycle and then a nice crisp bullish cross with separation on the other end of the cycle. If we see many little crosses during the cycle, it is a sign that the trend is not strong. Here is an example of the cycles you will see. There are many more annotated charts at the bottom of this article.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="OP_Is_Early">1OP Is Early</h2>
<p>The 1OP crosses tend to be early. I don’t know of another indicator that is predictive (not reactive) and that makes 1OP very special. That also means we need technical confirmation. If the SPY price action indicates a weak up trend and if 1OP is starting to peak, I suggest scaling out of some longs when it crosses. If I see wicks or a bearish hammer or a bearish engulf near the high, I suggest exiting the remaining long positions. Don’t take a short position until you see a technical breakdown. In the first bearish cross below we did not have technical confirmation and the market continued higher. There was no reason to take a short position. An hour later we can see that 1OP crossed back up and we had another bearish cross. It was still too early to short. Finally, we have long wicks at the high of the day and a long red candle. That is when you can take a short position. Don’t guess that 1OP is going to cross, wait for it to happen. The indicator is early and if it has not even crossed, you are early-early. This is like Home Depot putting snow blowers out on Labor Day (which I have seen). We don’t need to be that early. We need technical confirmation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Divergences">Divergences</h2>
<p>When 1OP is going up and the market is going up, that is normal (they are correlated). When the market is going up, and 1OP is going down, that is a bullish divergence (they are inversely correlated). We can expect these inverse correlations during strong trends higher and they confirm the trend strength. If during the day you saw stacked green candles on heavy volume with little to no overlap, you know from previous articles, this is a strong up trend. That means that you do not have to be overly concerned about a pending bearish 1OP cross. It is likely to be a bullish divergence. During that bearish cross you can expect a small market pullback. As long as there are not any long red candles and the dip is relatively shallow and brief, stay the course. The next bullish cross will be a good one and with this type of price action, you might actually add to long positions. In the chart below we have a nice bearish trend day. There are no retracements and there are many red candles. The volume is heavy so we can expect a bearish divergence (1OP up and market down). Here you can see that the market actually went down when 1OP was rising. That would be a classic bearish divergence and this is a sign that the next bearish cross will be good. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Correlation_to_Other_Indicators">Correlation to Other Indicators</h2>
<p>1OP does not correlate with other indicators. I have to laugh because I see many traders say that they have figured 1OP out. That it is based on this indicator or that indicator. 1OP might track another indicator for a short period of time, but ask yourself which other indicator moves opposite to the market some of the time and with it at other times? Most indicators were developed decades ago and there are many variants for those older indicators. I assure you, that is <strong>not</strong> 1OP. It is 100% proprietary and that makes it unlike any other indicator. Not knowing what makes 1OP tick really bothers some traders. They won’t trade it for that reason. Don’t be like them. Watch it work and gain confidence in it. Most of us don’t know the inner workings of an engine, but we get into a car and drive it because it works.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Zero_Line">Zero Line</h2>
<p>The zero line helps us determine the degree of movement in 1OP and where the cycles might begin and end. When 1OP stays tight to the zero line, it is a sign that there is likely to be very little market movement. This will often happen during light volume compressions and you should keep your trading to a minimum. In the chart you can see how shallow the crosses are. The price action is very choppy and we can see that in the mixed overlapping candles. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="OP1_1OP2">1OP1 &amp; 1OP2</h2>
<p>1OP2 is the fast line and 1OP1 is the slow line. Be careful not to jump to early conclusions when it comes to crosses. Wait for them to happen. Remember, 1OP is early so there is no reason to “jump the gun.” If 1OP1 is still rising in a bullish cycle and 1OP2 crosses below it, wait until 1OP1 flattens out before considering a short position. Often, there is still more market upside and 1OP will cross back up and there will be another bearish cross later. The same is true during a bearish cycle. If you see a bullish cross and 1OP2 is above a 1OP1 that is still falling, wait for 1OP1 to flatten out. 1OP could cross back below 1OP1 and the cycle might not have completed. In the chart below, you can see that we have a better entry point when we waited for that second cross. 1OP2 flattened out and that was a better signal. We also have nice separation between the lines and that is desirable. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Using_1OP_With_LRSI">Using 1OP With LRSI</h2>
<p>Some traders struggle with the concept of divergences and LRSI is very helpful in these instances. They are also quick to take gains during a strong trend and they should let those trades run. LRSI smooths out the RSI (RSI does not measure a stock’s relative strength to the SPY, it compares current SPY movement to previous SPY movement). This smoothing takes out some of the fake moves and it makes the indicator “sticky.” The LRSI default is a gamma of .5. When the indicator is below 20 and it rises above 20, a buy signal is generated. If it falls back below 20 before it reaches 80, it is back on the sell signal. Typically, it will rise above 80 after crossing above 20. In this instance, it will stay on a buy signal until it falls back below 80. If it quickly rises back above 80 it is back on the buy signal. Typically, once it is on a sell signal, it will fall below 20. It would remain on a sell signal until it rises back above 20. That is the cycle for the indicator. Because it is not as prone to head fakes, it will stay on a buy or a sell signal longer. If you have identified a bearish trend day and if you tend to bail on trades too soon, use LRSI. It is in the All Studies dropdown in Option Stalker Pro. In the chart below, you would follow the 1OP bearish cross and you would stay short until LRSI &gt; 20. This strategy helps you stick with the short during the 1OP bullish cross. That 1OP cycle turned out to be a bearish divergence and LRSI kept you in the trade. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Benign_Cycles">Benign Cycles</h2>
<p>When a cycle does not produce any movement, there is a good chance the next cycle will produce. We use the phrase “benign” when the market is <strong>not</strong> in a strong trend and divergence when it is in a strong trend. The market might be choppy and in a wide compression for instance. With each benign cycle, the odds that the next cycle will be good increase. You can see many examples of this in the annotated charts provided below. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Annotated_Charts">Annotated Charts</h2>
<p>I frequently post annotated charts in the chat room that give the play-by-play of how the day unfolded. They are packed with information and the goal is to help you read price action. They all include 1OP and you can see how it performed. These charts are a great way to get a feel for the indicator and to learn how to read price action. Scroll back on an M5 chart of the SPY using Option Stalker Pro and track 1OP each day. You will be amazed that the market is in a nice uptrend without any signs of danger and 1OP will have a bearish cross. It is signaling that there is “danger ahead” before there are any signs of it. Then you will see the market drop. It is the only indicator that I know of that is predictive and not reactive. The price for that information is that we have to put up with some of its quirky behavior. <a href="https://oneoption.com/annotated-charts/">Here is a link to the annotated charts</a>. You will find them in The Edge along with hundreds of articles and videos. </p>
<p>If you try to stuff 1OP into a box and put a pretty bow on it, you will get very frustrated. Don’t ask, “Does it always do this and does it always do that.” Let it do its thing and try not to generalize. This article is your blueprint for what to look for. In a market with wide swings, it will tell us when to take gains and when to watch for a possible reversal. When we have a strong trend, a divergence will confirm the trend strength. 1OP is a big part of my /ES trading. I read price action and 1OP is all I use. Nice high volume days with wide price swings and crisp crosses are the best. Once you master it for SPY M5, you can apply it to QQQ or other indices. You can also use 1OP for stocks, but those trends are stronger and you have to be able to identify divergences. </p>
<p>Here are 10 annotated charts from the last two months. Study them and gauge how 1OP performed during various market conditions. I think you’ll like it.</p>
