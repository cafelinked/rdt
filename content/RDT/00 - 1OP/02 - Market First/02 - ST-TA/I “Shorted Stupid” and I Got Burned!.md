<p>The longer term market trend is down and last week I posted an article on shorting “Gap and Go” patterns when the market is gapping down. Let’s review a couple of the key points.&nbsp;<a href="/the-system/market-first/short-term-technical/price-patterns/trend-days/how-to-spot-and-trade-bearish-trend-days/">Click here</a>&nbsp;to read the first article. If you are interested in watching in-depth video explaining the topic, <a href="https://youtu.be/FmhUYeGCGgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use this link.</a></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;“Gap and Go” formations are not something we want to chase as day traders. Much of the move has been exhausted just from the gap and the continuation is often limited for that reason. When the longer term market trend is down, we don’t want to chase a gap up. Most of these moves will be gap reversals and not “Gap and Go’s”. The exception would be strong signs of support off of a relative low on a longer term chart marked by a bullish hammer/bullish engulf off of the recent low, followed by consecutive days of stacked green candles. This would indicate a possible capitulation low (selling climax).</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;We have to expect bounces on these “Gap and Go” formations. The move from the closing price the previous day to the climax of the first leg is dramatic. That will prompt profit taking and we can expect a contra move. This is true for gaps down and gaps up.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Given the longer term bearish market trend, we can chase a “Gap and Go” formation if we see&nbsp;<em><strong>consecutive long red candles with little to no overlap on heavy volume</strong></em>. This EXACT pattern tells us that the selling pressure is heavy and that we can expect a bearish trend day.</p>
<p>Yesterday the market gapped lower on the open and it continued to drift lower. Traders see what they want to see and some probably shorted early in the day. They remembered the lesson I posted last week and they convinced themselves to “short stupid”. They operated under the notion that “Pete told me I can short into a bounce and not to be worried because the low of the day was not in”. They understood that they might take some heat and that they would have to weather the storm. Then the market bounced violently. It took out the high of the day and it entered the overnight gap. BTW, this does not happen on a Gap and Go bearish trend day because the selling pressure is too heavy. The market will stay below the high of the day (often established in the first 10 minutes of trading).</p>
<p>Next the market completely filled in the gap. This is when most novice traders would have taken the loss and puked out the position. This is also when they question everything that they thought they learned.</p>
<p>Where did they go wrong? They did not pay attention to my lesson. Time and time again I mentioned that this EXACT pattern had to be present and to accept no substitutes. “What’s the big deal, I had mostly red candles and so what they had a little overlap?” The drop from the open yesterday was not brisk and urgent and the volume was light. Every drop was met with immediate buying and the candles retraced. This is a sign of a weak trend and support. In the spirit of “Gap and Go” formations those retracements were an early warning sign that the bid is fairly strong and that the bounce could be decent.</p>
<p>So why are consecutive stacked long red candles on heavy volume so damn important and what are they telling us? They are a sign of relentless heavy selling pressure. Bids are smashed, crushed, pounded, trashed and hammered by sellers. Use any adjective you can think of, the market can’t come up for air. Immediately, buyers start to pull bids. They can see the conviction and they get the hell out of the way. Sellers are attacking anything in sight and that is why the volume is heavy. This is also a sign that any bounce will eventually fail and that the sellers will be back with a vengeance. That is what sets up the bearish trend day.</p>
<p>No one actually complained that they followed my lesson and lost money, but I am sure some traders got caught. When I tell you to follow an exact pattern, you need to understand what the candles are telling you.</p>
<p>In the chart below, you will see long consecutive stacked red candles closing on their low with little to no overlap on heavy volume later in the day. Now that’s a move you can get behind and that is a move where you can “short stupid”.</p>
<p>In the chart below you can see the entry and exits presented during the day. If you do not have the 1OP indicator, just pay attention to the price patterns I am watching for.</p>
<p>I hope this follow-up article helps you.</p>
