<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Some flat opens turn into “Inside Days” and some turn into solid trading days. </h4>
<p>When the market opens inside of the prior day’s range on light volume, that is a warning sign that we could be in for a dull day. Your guard should be up instantly and you should error on the side of not day trading until you see some directional movement. Before the “opening bell” you should routinely zoom out and consider the longer term context. If the market has been in a gradual light volume float higher with tiny bodied candles, that is a form of compression. It could be in a light volume drift lower or it could be in a horizontal compression. If the market has been in a strong trend, we will notice stacked long candles. If the volatility has been high, we will see long-bodied mixed candles on heavy volume. The longer-term market context is going to tell us what to expect because the market tends to keep doing what it has been doing.</p>
<p>A flat open starts the day where it finished the previous day. Some flat opens turn out to be “Inside Days” where the range today is “inside” of the prior day’s range. This is important because “Inside Days” are typically bad for day trading. Some flat opens turn into decent trading days. In this article we will discuss both types of day’s and when to expect each of them. </p>
<p>Let’s cover the worst case macro backdrop for day traders where the market is in a tight long-term compression. The candle bodies are tiny and the volume is light. With this backdrop, you should not force day trades. A flat open is likely to turn into an “Inside Day” and even if it pokes through the prior day’s range, that breakout could easily fail. The ranges are tiny so there are not many sustained intraday moves. Stocks hit our radar when they move. There is no follow through and by the time we see them, they are ready to reverse. Day traders will force trades and they will die by a thousand little cuts. Scalpers will also find it hard to make money day trading in this low probability trading environment (LPTE). I’ve been through these stretches. Most of the moves come overnight and then the market just sits there the next day. If you did not have any swing trades on, you struggled to make money and this can be down right depressing. This prompted me to write an article on why swing trading needs to be a part of your game plan. Let’s set the tone with a longer term chart. In the chart below this worst case scenario can be seen in the blue boxes labeled Dull.</p>
<p>If the action the previous day’s have been dull and if the volume has been light, we have to expect that the market is going to continue that pattern. This is especially true ahead of major holidays or when the news cycle is light. There are times when the market is in a general compression and the intraday ranges are compressed with tiny D1 candles.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at times when the market has a trend or volatility and where there are some surrounding candles with decent size on good volume. These periods are easy to spot in the chart above. The market does not go straight up or straight down. If the range was fairly wide the previous day and if the market finished well off of the HOD or the LOD, there is a good chance this will be an “Inside Day”. How do I know that? The previous day’s range was wide so it will take a lot of movement to get to either extreme and the open today is flat. It stands to reason that the prior day’s high (HOD) and the prior day’s low (LOD) will serve as resistance and support respectively and that we will stay in that range. As you can see in the chart above, long candles are often followed by pauses. If the open is flat and we breakout of the range, we could have an excellent trading day especially if that move happens early in the day on heavy volume. This is the exception and not the rule. Typically if the market is going to breakout of that big prior range, it will gap up or down the next day and the open will NOT be flat.</p>
<p>In the example below, the S&amp;P 500 had a big 80 point drop the previous day. That means that a flat open is likely to turn into an “Inside Day” and this will be a day of rest. To the left of the chart we can see that the price action was choppy and dull and the range was 30 points wide. The market closed in the middle of the range and this was a pause. It is fairly common to see this type of choppy price movement in a compressed range after a big move. The action is likely to resume in the next day or two. The previous day the market made a big move and it closed well inside of the range. We knew a pause was likely. We had a flat open and we expected an “Inside Day”. Is all of the recent volatility gone? That is not likely because the market keeps doing what it has been doing. That movement is just not going to happen today.</p>
<p>The next day we can see that the market opened flat. It quickly tested the bid and buyers were active. That resulted in a bullish hammer and the SPY took out the prior day’s high early in the day. The volume was decent and this was a sign that we are likely to have a decent trading session. The prior day’s high and the prior day’s low are the first technical resistance and support levels respectively. If we can’t get through those levels quickly, we understand that we could be in for a dull day. As the day progresses, buyers show their interest and the bounce is holding all of its gains and the selling pressure from two days earlier is gone. The market makes a new high of the day on good volume. Before the opening bell, we were prepared knowing that this flat open today was likely to gain traction after a day of rest. We watched for a breakout or a breakdown. Buyers and sellers were going to return so we expected to see directional movement in the first hour of trading. </p>

<p>In the next chart we have three trading days. The first day (left) we can see another big market move and a gap reversal. That big move is followed by a flat open. Buyers take the first shot and we can see a bounce. Then sellers are active and they test the bid. The range is set and the market stays in it the rest of the day. We know that an “Inside Day” is likely after a big move so we are prepared for it. The third day is the one we are interested in. The overnight move is flat and the market opened right where it closed previously. Buyers instantly show interest and we clear the prior day’s high immediately. That sets a bullish tone and the market grinds higher the rest of the day. The point is that a flat open does not always translate into a dull day. In this case, the rally was nice and we had a bullish trend day. From a day trading standpoint, we don’t really care which way the market breaks as long as it gets through the prior day’s range. If the market had breached the prior day’s low, that would have been fine as well. That would indicate that sellers are ready to pound bids after a day of rest and the move lower would resume. The market has been volatile and after a day of rest, buyers and sellers were not likely to be dormant. We expected a move and we needed to wait for a move outside of the prior day’s range.</p>

<p>This is not a hard lesson, but it is an important one so let’s review. Get the overall market context from a longer term chart. If the general price action for the market has been dull, you will see that in the daily chart. All of the candle bodies will be tiny and you can see that in the blue boxes below. This is “context” and it sets up our expectations. Those tiny bodies are a sign that the opening price is near the closing price. If the wicks and candles are also tiny, the ranges will be tight and we can expect many dull days. Under these conditions you have to do more swing trading. Your day trading should be minimal. Trim your size and your trade count and go into “hit and run” mode (scalping). If the trend is strong or if conditions are volatile, day trading conditions will be good. Flat opens don’t necessarily translate into dull days. If the market is not able to get through the prior day’s range after a flat open in the first hour and if the volume is light, we are likely to have a dull day. If the candles are long the previous day (big move), we can expect a pause the next day if the open is flat. What if the open is not flat? That would mean there is an overnight gap after a big day so <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/short-term-technical/gaps/">use the information from the article on how to trade gaps</a>. When the backdrop is favorable for day trading and a big move is followed by an “Inside Day” and a flat open, today could be a good day once we get through the prior day’s range. The market has had nice long candles on heavy volume. That volatility is likely to resume after a day of rest because it tends to continue what it has recently been doing. This is the mindset you need to have during flat opens.</p>
