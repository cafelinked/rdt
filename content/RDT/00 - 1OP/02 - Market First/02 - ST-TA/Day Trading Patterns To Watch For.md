<h4 class="wp-block-heading">These patterns are important for long-term and short-term trading, but we lean heavily on them when we Day Trade.</h4>
<p>Before we get started, please make sure that you’ve read the first article on <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/long-term-technical/price-action/reading-groups-of-candles/">groups of candles</a> in the long-term technical analysis section. The beauty of learning how to read price action is that the same concepts can be applied to any time frame. Here are some patterns that we use frequently for day trading and short-term swing trading.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Overlap</h4>
<p>When we are gauging trend strength, one of the first things we notice is overlapping candles. If the current candle moves into the previous candle it has overlap. To be clear, tiny bodied candles don’t have overlap, they are typically retraced completely. The focus for this section is on candles that have some decent length relative to other candles. We have two examples below so let’s focus on the bullish side knowing that the same principles apply to bearish moves. If we have a long green candle, it is a sign that buyers are aggressive. They were able to lift the “ask” and that resulted in a longer than average candle. The ultimate scenario is that the volume is heavy and the current candle low is the high from the previous candle. That is what we call “stacked” and it is a sign of aggressive buying especially if we can stack a few of them consecutively. We don’t see that often, but when we do, we expect follow through buying. Most candles will have some retracement. The next best case for continuation would be a current candle that dips into the previous candle, but the half-way point is preserved. Buyers want to buy any dip and they layer bids at a lower prices. Sellers recognize the strength (they hit bids and the bids are replenished instantly) so they hold off on additional sell orders because they expect higher prices. The current candle finishes higher than the open and it finishes above the high from the previous candle. The outcome is a nice green candle with a tail. That move higher should continue and this is a moderately strong pattern, but it is not as strong as a stacked candle. A less desirable combination for bullish traders is a current candle that retraces the entire previous candle and that can’t get through the high from the previous candle. It does finish close to the previous candle close and it could have a small red body or a small green body. This level of retracement tells us that sellers had the power to “clear” those bids. Buyers did return, but not with a vengeance. If this rally continues with similar candles, the move higher will be very tenuous and eventually the trend is vulnerable to a reversal. If the current candle closes below the mid-point of the previous long green candle and it has a wick, we are getting close to resistance. Buyers tried to advance the stock and sellers overpowered them. In the chart below, the pattern on the left is fairly decent. This move should have more upside. The candles are overlapping, but they are green and they are finishing above the previous high. The pattern on the right is weaker. We can see that the current candle is retracing the entire previous candle and they are closing below the prior high. This move higher is vulnerable to profit taking and it is getting exhausted.</p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Wicks and Tails</h4>
<p>The area above the body of the candle is called the wick and the area below the body is called the tail. If the body of the candle comprises less than half of the range, the tails and wicks are considered to be long. If the body finishes in the middle of the range, it is a sign of indecision. Long wicks and tails are your clue. They are telling you that the stock finished well off of its high and well off of its low. When we see these candles in the middle of a trend, it is a sign that at very least, a pause is coming. The trend could continue, but it might take time to digest the recent move. When the body of the candle is less than a quarter of the range and the range is normal, I consider this to be a doji. The classic definition is that the close is equal to the open for a doji. I am less interested in perfect conformity to a definition and I am more focused on what the candle is telling me. Buyer and sellers have both taken a shot and they moved the stock around. The open and the close were near each other and neither side was able to move the needle. This is a sign of indecision. As traders, we should expect a move one way or the other and we need to wait for it. When we see mixed candles with long tails and wicks, it is a sign that a compression is likely, particularly if this happens on light volume. Neither side has control and you should reduce your trade count and trade size. When the wick or the tail is long and the body is at the high or the low of the range we have a “hammer”. Let’s cover that next. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hammers</h4>
<p>Hammers are candles that have a nice range and they either have a long wick or a long tail. The body is small by comparison and it is concentrated on one end of the range. If the wick is long and the body is at the low end of the range, it is a bearish hammer. By definition, the close should be lower than the open, but that is not that important to me. I prefer red bearish hammers, but the message is the same. The stock tried to rally and sellers drove the price down. If the tail is long and the body is at the high end of the range, it is a bullish hammer. By definition, the close of the candle should be higher than the open. I prefer green bullish hammers, but the price action tells me that buyers are engaged. Buyers drove the stock to the upper end of the range. In the chart below we see a bearish hammer on the left side of the chart. This candlestick pattern is very important at a relative high. It is a sign of stiff resistance. Notice the two long green candles before it. At one time, the bearish hammer was a third stacked “green”. Buyers were excited and they expected lift-off. When the candle completed, the complexion changed dramatically. Tip: This is why we do not assume that a candle will finish strong or weak, we wait for it. Often it will change at the last second. Sellers imposed their will and they smashed bids. Soon FOMO buyers who rushed in to buy that third stacked “green” that was forming will regret that trade. When they bail it will add to the selling pressure. Would you have avoided this trap? I hope so, the two stacked “greens” came on light volume and there was overlap. No reason to chase this move, wait for the candle to complete. As sellers take control, we see mixed overlapping candles on low volume. That is a sign that the trend lower is weak. Two nice long red candles are a sign of selling pressure and a third long red candle is forming at the low. When it completes, it turns into a bullish hammer and the trend reverses. See how this works? </p>

<p>Some of you are going to read this and think, “Pete doesn’t know shit about candlestick patterns. He doesn’t even know the rules.” I’ve read the books (Nison and Pring are good authors) and constructed searches for these exact patterns. When I looked at the results, I realized that I was missing some of the best trades because they did not fit the definition perfectly. That’s when I started to focus more on what the price action was telling me and less on the definition. Don’t memorize definitions, learn the message and then you won’t need to know about “abandon babies” and “evening stars” and three dogs barking (made that one up). </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Engulfing Candles</h4>
<p>When I think of engulfing candles, I think of the first video game I played called Pac-Man. The current candle consumes the entire previous candle. By definition, the current candle needs to open above the prior high and it needs to close below the prior low to qualify as a bearish engulfing candle. Think about this. Most candles have a wick. On an intraday chart, the stock for some reason has to gap up above the high on the next M5 bar and then it has to tank and close below the prior low. You might see this on a D1 chart because we have overnight gaps, but you are very rarely going to see this intraday. So here is what I want for my bearish engulfing candles. If the previous candle had a long wick, cool. Sellers are lined up. I want the open of the current candle to be roughly equal to the previous close. Buyers are still interested, but that enthusiasm is about to get squashed. Sellers smash the bid and they drive the stock down. This is the important part for my definition. I want to obliterate the previous low and I want to close well below it. I want a nice long red candle and a tiny tail. That price action tells me that sellers are in complete control and buyers were powerless (candle closes near the low). When we get this pattern near a relative high, it is a sign that a short-term high is forming. This could also be the start of a trend reversal. In the chart below, you can see this pattern on the left side of the chart. Mixed overlapping green candles are a sign of weak trend strength and this bearish engulfing candle confirms it. The down trend features some nice long red candles and then we have a bullish hammer (by my definition) at the low. The classic definition is that the open of the bullish engulfing candle is lower than the low of the previous candle and the close of the bullish engulfing candle is higher than the high from the previous candle. Again, you might see this on a daily chart because of overnight gaps, but you will not see this intraday. I want the low of the current candle to be close to the low of the previous candle. In this case, the long tail of the previous candle is welcome and I don’t care that we are not close to it. Buyers are already lined up. The open of the engulfing candle is roughly equal to the close of the previous candle. Now for the part that really matters. I want buyers to lift every “ask” in sight and to leave sellers powerless. That will yield the long bodied green candle. I want that close substantially above the high from the prior candle and I want that wick to be tiny. That is a sign of support and aggressive buying. At very least, we can expect a bounce and that will be a short-term low. It could lead to a trend reversal and this pattern is most potent near a relative low.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Retracements</h4>
<p>Stocks do not go straight up or straight down. We should expect pauses and “fits and spurts” along the way. The frequency, duration and magnitude of these retracements help us gauge trend strength. In the chart below we can see that the trend is relatively weak. There are mixed overlapping candles with tiny bodies and the volume is light. We can trade this trend, but we have to be very careful. The rug can get pulled out at any time. Ride the momentum and watch for any sign of trouble. In this case, you can see the bearish engulfing candle after the new high. This is a sign for you to take profits on long positions and it might be time to line up some shorts. The market tries to recover, but it can’t get anywhere close to the previous high. These are signs that the weak trend has run out of gas. After a couple of consecutive red candles with heavy volume and a trendline breach, we can be confident a reversal is coming. This is a major retracement and 3 hours worth of bullish price action are erased in 15 minutes. Notice how that heavy selling pressure into the close spilled over to the next day and we had a big overnight gap down. Try to visualize a pattern that I am going to describe to you. There is a trend down with overlapping candles and each bounce retraces more than half of the recent move. That pattern repeats so there are lower highs and lower lows. These are major retracements so the trend lower is weak. In your mind connect the highs and connect the lows. Can you visualize the pattern? If you guessed a downward sloping channel, you are correct. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>When the trend is strong, the retracements should be brief and shallow. Let’s use a bearish example since I have a chart ready. The same concept applies to bullish trends. I like pauses and bounces during the drop to last less than 30 minutes. If they last longer than that, it is a sign of support. If the pause lasts less than 30 minutes it is a sign that sellers are aggressive. We measure moves from the last bounce or pause to the next bounce or pause. The blue shaded area below represents a leg from the move down. We want the retracements to be less than half of that move. If that half-way point is preserved, it is a sign of trend strength. If the down trend features bearish Key Bars, we want the open of those key bars to be preserved (I will right an article on Key Bars). Sellers were aggressive at the start of that Key Bar, and we want to know they are still there. During the decline we also want to see heavy volume. That is another sign that the drop is legitimate. When the retracements in a downtrend are minor, it is a sign of heavy selling pressure. Bounces can’t gain any traction because sellers are playing “Whack-A-Mole” every time the stock tries to get off the deck. Often, buyers will throw in the towel on the notion that the will be able to buy at a lower price. The bid crumbles and the selling pressure accelerates. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Double Tops and Bottoms</h4>
<p>In the <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/long-term-technical/price-action/reading-groups-of-candles/">previous article</a> on longer-term price patterns we discussed double tops and double bottoms. These are very important day trading patterns so they are worth repeating. When we have a very strong up trend we have to be very cautious trading trend reversals. We have to make sure that sellers are in control. The first kink in the armor could simply be a bullish flag and the market continues higher. It has been my experience that a strong up trend will usually have 3 bullish flags before it tires. Don’t focus on that number, focus on the patterns. As long as the retracements are minor, the trend is intact. When the trend is exhausted one of the dips will not recover and the high will not be challenged. This will result in a lower high double top. Now we know that sellers have control and we can start to scale into bearish positions. In the chart below you can see how that the trend is not strong. I choose this example because I can show both in one chart. Let’s assume the trend was strong. The wicks are a sign of resistance and we get the first dip. On the rebound, the market was not able to get back to the high. This is a sign of weakness and we can start shorting. That move culminates with a bullish hammer. In the context of the entire trading day, this is a higher low double bottom. This is a fairly choppy trading day. When the market makes a move it tests the range extreme and it pauses. When that move stalls, it tests the other side. </p>

<p>If you’ve followed the course outline, you should have a good understanding of individual candles, groups of candles and the patterns we like to day trade and swing trade at this stage. We will reinforce these concepts in the Stock section. When you learn to read price action it does not matter which time frame you are looking at. The principles are the same and they help us to gauge buying and selling pressure. </p>
