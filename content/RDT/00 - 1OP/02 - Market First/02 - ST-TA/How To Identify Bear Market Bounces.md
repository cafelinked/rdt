<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The market does not go straight down. Take profits on shorts when you see this pattern.</h4>
<p>We are in a bearish trend and just when the profits are starting to stack up, a violent snap back rally strips those gains away. The key is to take gains on those big drops and then to reloaded on failed bounces. Here is a sign that a bounce is coming.</p>
<p>On a daily chart you can add Bollinger Bands (BB). When the S&amp;P 500 touches the lower band the market is oversold. That is NOT a reason to take gains on shorts. The market can stay oversold for long periods of time and it can keep dropping. When the S&amp;P 500 rides the lower BB for at least a few days and it is making lower lows, watch the price action very carefully. If the candles start to overlap and you see mixed candles, it is a sign that support is forming. If the S&amp;P 500 rides the lower end of the BB and it continues to stack red candles or to make substantial new lows, stick with your short positions.</p>

<p>Since we are day traders we can trade the long side on these bounces, but we need to be selective and we do NOT want to overstay our welcome. I suggest using smaller size because it is just a matter of time before the sellers return. When you trade the long side you will also be very aware of when resistance is starting to form because you are watching the action tick-by-tick. When the bounce starts to stall and the selling pressure builds, you will know when it is time to start shorting again.</p>
<p>When the market is ready to bounce there will be a constant “bid check”. Sellers will try to pound the bid. Every time the market bounces in a bearish trend, the sellers will test the bid to see how aggressive buyers are. Eventually, gaps down will be bought and they will form green candles on the chart. Those gap reversals will close on the high. When we get a second gap down that bites into prior gap reversal and then it also recovers, you know the bid is strengthening. Next you want to see a nice green candle that closes above the high from those prior green candles. If you see this pattern, you can expect a bounce.</p>

<p>I believe that we are setting up for a bounce here. It might last a few days or a few weeks. We don’t know and if you are in cash, you don’t care. The height and duration of that bounce will tell us how aggressive/passive buyers are. These bounces can destroy your profits on short positions so beware.</p>
<p>We are still not seeing those gap down reversals and green candles, but we could see them very soon. Now you know what to look for and what to do.</p>
