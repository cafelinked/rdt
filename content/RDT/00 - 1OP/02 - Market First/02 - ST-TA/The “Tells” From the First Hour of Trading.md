<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t trade the first 30 minutes, evaluate the price action. Here’s what to look for.</h4>
<p>You’ve been researching the market for two hours before the open. You’ve gathered your information and you know the key price points, the overseas back drop, the opening indication, stocks that are of interest and all of the other key elements you need. Your scenario analysis is complete and you have a game plan for each outcome. Now it’s time to see how everything plays out. Here are some of the key elements to watch for in the first hour. The early bars will provide you with valuable information. </p>
<p>I can’t continue without addressing context one more time. How does today’s puzzle piece fit into the big picture? I’ve written many articles about context and those considerations need to be addressed when you are constructing your scenario analysis. It’s important to understand what is actually happening in the first hour of trading. </p>
<p>Most days have a gap, so let’s start with those charts. They are not all of equal importance. In my opinion a true gap up clears the prior day high and a true gap down clears the prior day low. Let’s discuss what happens during any gap up. The same concepts apply to gaps down and I have an entire article devoted to trading gaps. </p>
<p>Large institutions are running programs to test the strength of the bid and the ask. They are jousting to see which side has greater strength. If they run a sell program to test the bid and they can’t move the price lower, they will buy back the short and go long if they are sufficiently satisfied that buyers are interested. They don’t care if they lose money on that sell program because they will make that money back and then some when they pivot (buy back the short and go long 2X). If they can move the bid it will be a sign that the buyers are not that strong. In this scenario they will add to the short to see if they can move it farther. If they sense weakness this could be a gap reversal. There is plenty of downside (profit potential) on a gap fill so they will add progressively. In general, overnight gaps tend to be over-extended. Was the news really that significant to justify the move? This is what they are trying to determine. In most cases, the move has “fluff” and that will be revealed very quickly when buyers show a lack of interest. Sellers will see that gap up as an excellent shorting opportunity and they will be aggressive. When the gap up holds, it is a sign that this early effort to reverse the move has been thwarted and that buyers are interested. Longs are supporting the gap up and they are offsetting any early selling with additional buy orders. Sellers will recognize the strength of the bid and they will ease up on the notion that they will be able to short at higher levels. If the open from a gap up survives the first 30 minutes, it is a bullish sign and it demonstrates that buyers want “in”. If the opening gap up falters in the first few candles, it is a sign that the move is over-extended. This same principle applies to gaps down. Was the overnight news significant enough to justify the move? Let’s run some buy programs and find out. </p>
<p>As a trader your job is to follow the “smart money”. How are you going to do that when the “smart money” does not know which side to favor? Let these games play out during the first hour of trading. If you don’t, you will be whipsawed. Your odds of success will be greatly reduced. When the dust settles you will be ready to attack. Use the first hour wisely and find the best prospects on both sides. Instead of managing losing trades you will be ready to pounce. Let’s look at the clues presented to us recently in the first hour of trading.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>The chart shows a gap up that starts with a green candle. Is this move through a key resistance level? Is it through the prior day’s high? You should know this from your pre-open analysis. If it is, this move is significant. Sellers will hammer that move because they will view it as an attractive level for a short. When the first candle in a gap up is green, that is slightly bullish. At minimum it suggests that a full out meltdown with gap reversal is slightly less likely. Buyers are defending that gap up and they are still interested in the move. Notice that although green, there was a slight kink in the armor. Sellers were able to push the market lower and that is why there is a tail. In a flat out gangbuster “grab everything you can get” move higher, you would not see a tail. The bid is so strong that everything is gobbled up. When the open of a gap up is the low for the first 30 minutes, that is a bullish sign. In this instance, they were able to move the bid slightly. The seller discovered that there is a “size” buyer at a lower price and they probably bought back the short and went long. That resulted in the tail and the bullish hammer. The next candle was long and green and it came on good volume. That is another bullish sign. Notice the wick above the second candle. That is a sign that sellers are still engaged. The buyers were not aggressive enough to hold the high from that bar. After the first 30 minutes on this day we can tell that the opening gap up is pretty firm. The market has been able to advance and buyers have the upper hand. This is not going to be a “run away” gap and go. We can see that there are pauses (dojis) and retracements (wicks and tails), but not mixed candles with overlap. There is a nice upward bias and the volume is decent. We can buy here with confidence, but we should expect pauses and small dips. The market is well below the prior day’s high so this is not a big breakout. Given the early action, we can expect decent resistance as the market challenges that price level.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A Weak Gap Up</h4>

                    </div>
                
<p>In this next example the market gapped higher and we can see a big range for the opening bar. This is a doji with a long wick and a long tail. Right off the bat this first candle tells us that we can expect volatility. Buyers and sellers are active (good volume) and they are flexing their muscles. The second bar looks good and it closed near its high, perhaps buyers are going to win this round. The third bar paints a completely different picture and it coincides with a bearish 1OP cross. The market tried to add to the gains and it was instantly smacked down. In all likelihood a few buy programs tested the ask. When they discovered “size” above they quickly pivoted (exited the longs and shorted 2X). That is why you see a bearish hammer at the high of the day. This is a very bearish formation and we know instantly that there is resistance. If you only saw the first two bars and the third bar was forming a long and green candle, you might have bought on the notion that the market was going to lift off. You made two critical mistakes. 1. You ignored what the first bar of the day was telling you. 2. You did not wait for the third candle to complete before you drew your conclusions. Often a bar will change its character in the last few seconds. Those mistakes are going to cost you. The third bar gives back all of its gains and it turns into a bearish hammer. The fourth bar is long and red with a big body. It takes out the open and the low of the day. Now we can be fairly certain the gap is going to fill. Sometimes it will take an hour to get a good market read and sometimes we will know after just 30 minutes of trading. In this instance the direction is clear. This is a heavy volume gap reversal and the forth candle barely retraced. It has a small tail and the wick of the fifth candle is short.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A Big Gap Down To A Major MA</h4>

                    </div>
                
<p>In the next chart we have a gap down. The first candle probes for support and buyers are marginally interested. There is a tail under the body of the candle, but it still closed lower than the open (red). The second candle shows another bid check. They tried to see if buyers were still active at the low of the day and they were. The volume was moderate and this time the SPY was able to close above its open (green). Now we have two bullish candles and the low seems to be holding. It’s time to check the ask. Buyers are encouraged by the support and the third candle probes into the gap. It is instantly smacked down and now we know there is resistance. After just 3 candles we know that the market is searching for direction. There is support near the low of the day and resistance in the gap. The volume is decent so we know both sides are active. The first low of the day coincided with the 200-day MA and we were aware of that. The fifth candle takes out the low of the day and it breaches the 200-day MA. This is very encouraging for bears. Perhaps this breakdown will gain traction and buyers will throw in the towel. It is followed by another red candle and this looks promising for bears. From this point on, shorts want to see nice steady progress lower. This major breakdown is just starting and the momentum should accelerate quickly. They expect to see nice stacked red candles, but that is not what they get. Instead we see two green candles that poke right back above the 200-day MA. This is a warning sign for shorts. The momentum never got going and we are already seeing signs of support? How could we have predicted this? The first few candles told you that buyers were interested. If they weren’t and if sellers were super aggressive you would have seen 3 long red candles stacked with a meltdown below the 200-day MA. We did not see that. You should have respected those early candles and only had a bearish starter position when the 200-day MA was breached. You can hang on to that position for a bit longer to see if a choppy move lower unfolds, but you should not be adding to the short position. Those two green candles told you to be cautious. The next series of candles are mixed and overlapping. This is a sign that the market has support and that there is NOT going to be a meltdown. You should take gains on your short positions and see if the bullish 1OP cross produces a bounce. If it does, buyers might flex their muscles. The volume is heavy and both sides are active. In this instance, the market did rally the rest of the day and it recovered the entire gap.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>In the next chart we have a big gap down and the opening print is the low of the day. That first candle finishes on its high and as someone who loves to trade gap reversals, this is a good sign. Buyers took the initiative right away. Although I would prefer a green second candle, it is red. It makes a new low of the day, but it does finish off of the low. The next two candles are bullish hammers. Once again, sell programs test the bid and in every instance, buyers are supporting that low. That is why we see tails under the body. The forth candle makes a new closing high for the day and it probes into the gap. This is very constructive price action and you can get long. The volume is light and there is retracement (tails and wicks). That means the move higher will be tenuous. No need to chase. Look for strong stocks, buy dips and don’t go overboard. The chance of having the rug pulled out from under you is minimal here.</p>

<p>Flat opens can be challenging especially if they open in the middle of the prior day’s range (“inside day”). When we have those, choppy price action unfolds and we might not have a clear sense of direction all day. Low volume “inside days” are common after a big market move the prior day, ahead of a major holiday or when major news (economic, the Fed or earnings) is pending. The warning sirens should be blaring when you have these conditions and you should be aware of them pre-open. These are low probability set-ups and you should avoid trading. At very least, trim your size and your trade count. This should be your mindset anytime the market can’t get outside of the prior day’s range. That high and low are the first lines of resistance and support respectively. If the market is able to clear those levels on the first attempt early in the day and if the volume is decent, the day can turn into an excellent trading session. The key is to watch for consecutive candles of a single color with little retracement and good volume. If the volume is light and the candles are mixed and overlapping, assume that you will be trapped in the range. </p>
<p>In this chart the previous day closed on its high so there was some upward momentum. The first thing we want to see is support. Were the gains from the prior day “fluff”? Was that move simply program driven? Are we going to hold the gains or give them back? Could buyers still be interested at this level? Those questions will be answered in the first hour of trading. Since the market closed on its high the prior day, we don’t have to travel far to clear it. The early gap up is instantly erased and the first bar is red. We will start the day right where it finished the previous day. Maybe we will see some profit taking. The next two candles are green and they quickly recapture the red candle. This is a sign that buyers might still be interested. The forth bar is the “tell”. It is a high volume bar with a big range and a body that covers most of that range (small tail and wick). We call those “Key Bars”. Buyers are interested. Sellers know to be cautious because bulls had the ball the previous day and the gains held overnight. The four candles that follow the “Key Bar” (hollow) do not retrace into it. They are all above it. Try as they might, sellers were not able to knock those gains back. This is a sign that the bid is strong. Now the market releases and we can take long positions with confidence. The volume is good and there is very little retracement. The red candles are tiny and we are in a bullish 1OP cycle. </p>

<p>In this chart the opening gap up is slapped down like Chris Rock at the Oscars. That is a long red candle and it gave back more than 15 S&amp;P 500 points. That is a sign that sellers are aggressive. The previous day we can see late day selling and sellers are still imposing their will. This is an “inside day” and we need to expect some chop because the volume is light. After a few more candles, we can see that that first red candle is being recovered. Long mixed candles, light volume, long tails and wicks and an “inside day” are warning signs. There is no need to rush into trades. As the day unfolds, we can see that the first attempt to get through the previous day’s high is successful. It took almost 90 minutes, but we can favor the long side. The volume is starting to improve and we can expect a choppy move higher with fits and spurts. Be patient, buy dips and be careful if the move gets over-extended. The first bar of the day reminds us that sellers are not far away and that is confirmed by the mixed candles on the way up.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A “Gap and Go” Down</h4>

                    </div>
                
<p>Next we have a nice gap down. The open was very close to the low of the day and the first candle was long and red closing on its low. This leaves little doubt that there is selling pressure and the volume is fairly heavy. The second candle is red and its wick was well below the half-way point of the red candle so the retracement is minor. Sellers are persistent and the market can’t get “off the deck”. Buy programs are trying to test the ask, but those orders are met immediately by sellers. When the market can’t bounce or retrace, it is a sign of heavy selling pressure. The programs can’t “lift the offer”, so they exit the long and start to short. That leads to the next long red candle. After the first hour of trading it is obvious that the selling pressure is heavy and that the market is going lower. As the day unfolds you can see that there are not any bounces. This is another bearish sign and we will cover that in another article.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>During this day, the market open was very flat. It opened below the prior close, but that close was also the high of the day. The market quickly recovered and we saw nice green candles. They were relatively small and they did have tails and wicks. The forth candle was nice and long and the market got through the prior day’s high. Volume is the missing element on this day so we need to take our time. The sixth bar was red. It was nothing daunting, but it was the first sign of selling. The market was able to quickly recapture that lost momentum and two bars later it made a new high of the day. Notice the wick on that candle. It is half the size of the entire range for that candle and it is a sign of resistance at the high of the day. The next candle attempts to get through the high of the day and the result is the same. Now we have two bearish hammers off of the high of the day. We have a bearish 1OP cross and now we want to watch the open from the last green candle. It failed so we should prepare for more selling pressure. This is a light volume day and the market just hit a brick wall. If the bearish cycle produces a big drop, we have to expect two-sided action the rest of the day. If the market is able to stay tight to the high of the day during the bearish cycle we can expect a choppy light volume grind higher. In this case, we did see fairly heavy selling and that was a sign there would be two-sided action the rest of the day.</p>

<p>We have two goals in the first hour of trading. 1. We are trying to determine market direction so that we can position ourselves on the right side of the action. 2. We are trying to gauge the strength of that move so that we can properly size our positions. If we see a powerful move on heavy volume we can expect a trend day. We can increase our size when we see this and we should be prepared to ride the wave higher for most of the day. If the candles are of a single color with some retracement (tails and wicks), but the volume is decent, we can get long with confidence and take profits along the way. We should not expect a “run away” rally or a meltdown. If the volume is decent and the candles are mixed and overlapping, it is going to be a volatile day. This is a “hit and run” market condition where you can try to trade both sides. Most traders should just pick one side and focus on finding those trades. Wait patiently and you will get your turn. When the market opens inside the prior day’s range and the volume is light – beware. The candles will be mixed and overlapping and your odds of success are low. It is very important that you know when NOT to trade and on these days, keep your powder dry. You will piss your capital away and you will be very frustrated with yourself. </p>
<p>This chart is a classic example of when NOT to trade. There is a small gap down on the open and the market tries to recapture those losses. The sixth bar is a giant red candle that comes out of nowhere. Once I see that type of price action I need to see follow through on the red candle. Did some news hit the market or is that move just noise? In this case there was no follow through selling and the market bounced. When I see this price action, I immediately go into defensive mode (don’t trade). The volume was decent, but we were way inside of the prior day’s range. This was going to be a choppy compression and an “inside day”. You can see the mixed candles that surfaced later in the morning.</p>

<p>Some days the early action is crazy and you will be glad you did not trade the first hour. It’s hard to make sense of the price action because there is good movement both ways and the volume is heavy. If the swings are violent, it is a sign that the programs are battling it out. We often see this type of action after a major news release (i.e. the Jobs Report). Institutions have their own take on the news and they are taking turns executing buy and sell programs. Listen to your brain. Watch from the sideline and let them battle it out. In the first 30 minutes of trading the market lost 40 S&amp;P 500 points in the example below. In the next 30 minutes it recovered those losses. One will eventually overpower the other and there will be a breakout. Sometimes the volatility will start to subside and a wedge will form intraday. You don’t want to stand in front of this freight train. Wait for a clear winner. You might get one early in the day or you might have to wait for a compression breakout after that wedge forms. The good news is that once a winner is revealed, you should have nice sustained movement in that direction. Other traders will be watching as well and they will support the side that wins once it is known.</p>

<p>This last chart frustrates many traders because the market looks great and you see a nice set-up. As soon as you enter, it looks horrible and you start to second guess yourself. In this chart you can see a gap up. The first candle was green and it opened on its low. That’s bullish – right? Not in this case. You can see that the attempt to push the market higher was instantly thwarted and that resulted in a bearish hammer. You should be on high alert after you see that, the gap up could be vulnerable. The next candle tests the ask and it closes well. The third candle makes a new high of the day, but sellers spank the market down on good volume. That red candle engulfs the other two candles and it takes out the low of the day. This could be a gap reversal. The forth and fifth candles are red and bearish. There is some retracement, but not much. This looks like a gap reversal and the gap is fairly close to filling. The prior day’s high is within reach. I certainly would have shorted this. The sixth candle almost filled the gap, but it finished as a doji and it closed near the high of its range. This is slightly bullish, but not enough to shake me out of a position. Candles 7,8 and 9 temper my bearish bias and I would reduce my shorts. These are a clear sign of support. The next 3 candles are green and consecutive. This is a nice bounce. After an hour of trading, I know that conditions are going to be volatile. These are big moves. That decent bounce is instantly stripped away by a long red candle and now it looks like the bearish scenario is back on track. The problem with this type of pattern is that short positions are hard to hold because the bounces are so large. It is also hard to re-enter shorts because the bounces look legitimate. When the next wave of selling hits you are caught flat-footed. By the time you re-establish your shorts, the next bounce is ready to start. This type of choppy price action with wild swings and a slight directional bias are classic signs that a trading channel is forming. The sooner you can identify it, the easier it will be for you to trade it. These days are tough to trade so keep your size small. We will talk more about them in a section where we analyze the market after the open. The key in the first hour it to try to identify the channel if one is forming.</p>
<p>Institutions run buy and sell programs early in the day to determine which side has the upper hand. Sometimes they know right away, sometimes it takes an hour and sometimes there is no clear direction. Our job is to follow the “smart money” and we can’t do that when they are still trying to figure out the path of least resistance. The first few candles of the day are critically important. They set the tone and there are valuable clues in how they start and finish, where they are relative to other candles and where they relative to the prior day’s range. Volume is also important. Without it we can’t trust what we see. After the first 30 minutes you might have a clear sense of direction. Nice sized consecutive candles of a single color on volume are always a sign that the momentum in one direction is strong. Other days the candles might not be as organized, but the direction and the type of day we are likely to encounter is clear after an hour of trading. There will be days when your trading should be light. It is critical to identify them in the first hour and to trim your size and your trade count. If you ignore the warning signs you will lose valuable capital and the day will take a psychological toll. </p>
