<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The first hour of the day provides valuable clues on how to plan your trading day. </h4>
<p>Before reading this article you should read the articles on <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/short-term-technical/gaps/">day trading gaps</a> and <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/short-term-technical/tells-from-the-first-hour-of-trading/">the first hour clues</a>. Often the first hour of trading sets the tone for what is going to happen the rest of the day. We can tell if a “Gap and Go” is likely or if a “Gap Reversal” is likely. We can also determine if this is going to be a low volume “Inside Day”. In the examples below, we are going to look at many trading days to see how the opening helped us forecast and plan for the remainder of the day. I decided to use 15-minute charts because we can look at many more days and because we can see how the prior day’s range helps us to gauge market strength/weakness.</p>
<p>In general, if the market can’t get through the prior day’s range, I am instantly in defensive mode. This is going to be a low probability session and I will decrease my size and activity on the notion that the volume will be light and the action will be choppy. If the market breaches the prior day’s range on good volume early in the day, day trading conditions should be favorable. With that in mind, let’s look at some charts. The dotted gray line represents a new day. You will see a three-day chart and below it you will see play-by-play commentary for each of the three days. The temptation is to gloss over the material. If you do that, the lessons are not likely to sink in. Try to read about each day and then look back at the chart to visualize the lesson. If you do this, they will sink in and your ability to read price action will improve. This is like a Black Jack “card counter” who flips cards for practice. The more you do it, the better you get at recognizing these patterns. </p>

<p></p>
<p>In the chart above the first day opens on a positive note, but the moves are jerky. The market runs and then pauses, runs and then pauses. This is not aggressive buying. There are “bid checks” along the way constantly. Remember with aggressive buying, the green candles are stacked consecutively. After the first hour of trading we are aware that there is a bullish bias, but the move is not incredibly strong. When the open of the last long green candle at the high of the day is breached, we know that a trend reversal is likely and it is time to shift to the short side. The selling pressure is steady and there are not many retracements or mixed candles. That is a bearish sign and eventually the low of the day is breached. </p>
<p>The second day the market first tests the upside. Perhaps the prior day’s selling was overdone so programs will test the “ask” and see how aggressive sellers are. That bounce is immediately squashed. The market then tries the downside next and that is immediately reversed (the low of the day is followed by a bullish engulfing candle). After the first hour of trading, the market is back inside of the prior day’s range and we know that this is likely to become a low volume “Inside Day”. As the day unfolds we see tiny bodied candles and our suspicion is confirmed. When we recognize this, we should instantly reduce our size and our trade count. It is time to be very picky and the opportunity has to be compelling to get us “off the fence”.</p>
<p>The third day, the market has a massive gap up and it clears the prior high. This is bullish price action and sellers will try to slap this move down. After an hour of trading, most of the gap has held. This is a sign that buyers are engaged and that the buying is fairly aggressive. That sets the tone for a nice move higher. We have to be aware of resistance at the high of the day and of the resistance level created by the high from two days earlier. The volume is good during the rally and the market is able to clear both levels. Notice how there are not any big dips? There are not any long red candles or organized (sequential) red candles. That is because buyers are overpowering sellers and the trend higher is strong. During trend days like this you should try to ride your longs and to set more aggressive targets. You might have to weather a few “speedbumps” but they are likely to be minor and the steady price action is telling you that. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The first bar in the 3-day chart above is a crazy smack down. The market gaps up and the bottom falls out. Instantly we should expect volatile conditions. We can’t join that selling until we have confirmation (follow through). Our patience pays off because that first move is instantly reversed. From the first hour of trading, we know that this is going to be a volatile day with movement both ways. The volume is heavy so we know buyers and sellers are active. The long tails and wicks on each of the bars is a sign of movement. Nothing is going to come easy on a day like this. If there is an upward bias, try to buy dips. When you have lift-off and a long green candle, take gains. These are big moves and you do not want to overstay your welcome. </p>
<p>On the second day, the market gaps down to the prior day’s low. We know that buyers and sellers have been active. That drop is instantly scooped up and we have stacked green candles in the first hour. This is bullish and we should plan for a gap fill. Sellers try to knock the market down, but most of the early gains are preserved. Buyers still have control. If they did not, we would have seen organized selling and the low of the day could have been challenged. That was not remotely the case. Buyers were interested and after a two hour pause in the middle of the day, sellers gave up. The market filled the gap and there was a nice opportunity to trade from the long side. The volume was much lighter this day.</p>
<p>On the third day, sellers wanted to test the bid right away. They tried to smack the market down and they wanted to see if the buyers were still active after the gap reversal the previous day. That first bar turned into a doji with a long wick and a long tail. Buyers and sellers were jousting. The next 3 bars were green and the market was well above resistance, but there were warning signs. There were bearish hammers at the high of the day and sellers were able to knock the market off of its high. This paved the way for a long red candle that pushed the market back into the prior day’s range. The volume was light and we know that both sides have been active in recent days. This was an equilibrium point and the rest of the day was likely to be dull. Trim your size and trade count.</p>

<p>All of the charts are sequential so you can go back to a previous chart if you want to note the transitions from one period to the next. The first day in the chart above follows the previous dull “Inside Day”. The market starts off on a bullish note and it gaps a little higher. The tiny bodied candles and long wicks/tails tell us that buyers and sellers are jousting and the direction has yet to be determined. After the first hour, a long red candle forms. It takes out the prior day’s low and it closes on its low. This is a long red Key Bar and we can expect more selling. During the next hour we have consecutive long red candles and we can be confident that a bearish trend day is unfolding. The lack of any bounces is a sign that sellers are relentless. Ride those shorts and don’t expect any kind of bounce until the last 30 minutes of trading. These are the days when you can be aggressive. If you are a “nervous Nellie” during an obvious trend day, you have to put your fears aside and stick with the trades. Use LRSI M5 with a gamma of .7. As long as it is below 20 (bearish trend day), stick with your shorts. We don’t get many trend days so don’t conjure them up. Those consecutive stacked candles of a single color on heavy volume are the clue. If there is a technical D1 breach, your odds of a trend day increase. </p>
<p>The next day the market gaps down. There is residual selling pressure from the day before, but the market has traveled a long way in a short time. The bid is fairly stubborn on the open and there is a failed attempt to try and rally the market and to fill in the gap. We know this because the early candles have wicks. Those attempts at a bounce were thwarted, but there are signs that buyers are marginally interested. How can you say that, the market gapped down? If the selling were relentless we would have seen stacked red candles right away. The fact that the gap down held is a sign that there is some support. The move lower has mixed overlapping candles. That is also a sign that there is a bid. This is NOT a meltdown. On the low of the day we see two consecutive green candles that wipe out the red candles. This is a bullish sign and buyers are interested. The market moves into the gap, but the candles are mixed with retracement. There is likely short covering after a nasty down day and the bounce is not strong. Much of the gap fills, but we know to be cautious at the prior day’s low. We needed to attack that resistance to get through it. That did not happen and sellers were able to push the market back down late in the day. The volume was heavy and both sides took their shot.</p>
<p> On the third day the market opened slightly higher and sellers attacked that instantly. Buyers defended that early drop and the first candle finished as a bullish hammer. This was a sign of strength and the next few candles breached the prior day’s high. As the move unfolded, the gap from two day’s prior was filled. Buyers clearly had control and this was going to be a bullish trend day. The volume was heavy and the market compressed in the middle of the day. Try as they might, sellers were not able to knock the market down. This was a bullish sign and once a new high of the day was established, sellers threw in the towel. During a bullish trend day, use LRSI (.70 gamma) to keep you in the position. As long as it stays above 80, ride those longs and set aggressive targets.</p>

<p>So the previous chart finished with strong upward momentum and there was follow through buying in the chart above on the first day. Stacked green candles on heavy volume were a sign that the market was going to move higher. In the middle of the day there was resistance at the high of the day and you can see that from the long wicks. That told us that selling pressure is starting to build. The market tried to make a new high for the day, but the green candle was erased by two red candles. Given previous signs of resistance, we needed to prepare for a pullback. Half of the daily gains were erased and that was a material pullback from the high. It tells us that sellers are active and not to expect a runaway rally. If the market had closed near the high of the day, it would have been a sign that buyers were clearly in control. We did not see that. </p>
<p>The second day the market struggled to preserve gains. Sellers were able to gain traction late in the prior session and the market gapped down. Notice the long wicks and tails? That is a sign of two sided action. We were “inside” of the prior range and the volume was light. We should’ve expected that the volatility would decrease because of the light volume and the tight range. This was a day to reduce your trade size and trade count. </p>
<p>The third day the market gapped down and it cleared the prior day’s low. The first candle was a doji with a long tail and wick. In the first 15 minutes buyers and sellers were jousting. We know from previous sessions that both sides are active. The second candle is long and red candle and it tested the low from two day’s earlier. It appears that sellers have control, but the first candle of the day and the previous sessions should have served as a warning. We should not have assumed that this would be a “Gap and Go”. Buyers were not just going to throw in the towel. The next few bars after the long red candle had long wicks and tails and the volume was heavy. The market was going to break one way or the other and we had to be patient. After two hours of trading, the market staged a big bounce and it cleared the high of the day and it entered the gap. Stacked green candles on heavy volume attacked the gap and that was a bullish sign. As the move unfolded the market rallied above the prior low of the day and there was very little retracement. The majority of the candles were green and this told us to favor the long side and to look for a possible gap fill. </p>

<p>Building on the prior day’s down gap reversal, the market gapped higher on the first trading session in the chart above. Could this be a “Gap and Go”? Not likely given the recent selling pressure. There is no need to guess, wait to see what happens. The gap up was instantly faded (challenged) and that created a bearish hammer. That is a clear sign of resistance. Is this going to be a “Gap Reversal”? We don’t know yet. This was certainly a bearish start and the second candle was also red. Sellers were active and we should have expected a gap fill based on the early action. The third and forth candles were green and that was a sign that buyers were engaged. They were not able to challenge the high of the day so we needed to wait patiently. At very least we knew that the market was not going anywhere fast. Buyers and sellers had flexed their muscles. The gap did fill, but based on the price action we should not have expected heavy selling. Both sides are interested. As the day unfolded, buyers were able to fuel a very gradual move higher. This was a backdrop where you could try a handful of bullish picks. The bias was up, but the candles were tiny and the volume was light. </p>
<p>The second day started off with 3 nice green candles. Unfortunately, the volume was light so we had to be suspicious of the move. The price action in recent days has seen strong moves both ways. If that early run had come on heavy volume it would have been bullish. As it turns out those gains were easily stripped away. After two hours of trading we had seen strong movement both ways so it was a sign not to be overly aggressive with our trading. Eventually, the market was able to make a new high of the day and it stayed tight to the high of the day. That was a sign that bulls had temporary control. The tiny bodied candles and the wicks told us that every move higher was challenged and that sellers were never far away. Given the battle earlier in the day, the bearish hammer off of the high of the day was a sign of resistance. It was time to exit long day trades. In the last 15 minutes of trading, sellers flexed their muscles and the gains from the last 3 hours were given back quickly. </p>
<p>The back-and-forth continues and the late day drop the prior day paved the way for a gap down on the third day. Buyers tried to fill the gap and the first 3 candles were green. The volume was light so this move did not pack much punch and we should have doubted it. Resistance formed before the gap was filled and sellers instantly slapped that rally down. A new low of the day was established and that was a fairly aggressive smack down. The low of the day held for a couple of hours, but buyers could not get the market “off the deck”. There was no bounce and that was a sign that there were a lot of sellers “on the ask”. A new low for the day was established mid-day and buyers threw in the towel. Sellers had control and a light volume drift lower gained traction. We’ve seen this movie before. The market finished right where it started three days earlier. Clearly, both sides are active. If the market makes a directional move and it stalls, look for a reversal the other way. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p> After a gradual drift lower the previous day, the market opens flat. This is an “Inside Day” with tiny bodied candles and light volume. There is a bullish bias with very little retracement. Favor that side, but don’t get aggressive. You need to keep your size small and your trade count low because the threat of having the rug pulled out is high. All it takes is one long red candle to wipe out hours of progress. This is also the day before the FOMC statement so we should be expecting a dull trading day. Traders are just doing some last minute position squaring and they are largely waiting for the Fed. </p>
<p>The market opened inside of the prior day’s range on the second day. Your primary thought should’ve been “dead till the Fed” and to error on the side of caution ahead of the statement two hours before the close. The volume is light and everyone is waiting for the statement. By all means you should be reducing risk ahead of the statement and that should be your primary activity. Take a nice long lunch. We can’t often do that as day traders so relax. Take a walk and get some fresh air because all hell is going to break loose in the last two hours of trading. In this instance, the market rallies right away. It is typically best to wait for 30 minutes after a Fed announcement. There can be incredible swings while the market digests the news and the press conference a half hour later can produce reversals. Once the price action settles down and the direction becomes clear, go with the flow. Don’t assume that what you see in the last two hours is going to continue the next day. These “knee jerk” reactions are often reversed overnight.</p>
<p>The next day the market gaps higher, but the first candle is red. That could be a sign of a gap reversal. The next two candles have long wicks and tails and relatively small bodies. This tells us that there is two-sided action. There could be a gap fill, but we should not expect a bloodbath. Buyers are still engaged and the gap did not completely fill. This is bullish and a long green candle off of the low of the day is a signal that the bid is still strong. The next candle establishes a new high of the day and buyers are back in control. Unfortunately, there is no follow through. The market compresses in a tight range and the volume is heavy. Buyers and sellers are paired off and the market could go either way. We know the early gap up was challenged right away so we should not assume that we are “off to the races”. The high of the day is hitting some resistance and it can’t advance. The candles are tiny with wicks and tails. Keep it light and wait for a breakout or a breakdown. In the afternoon, buyers are able to force a breakout and we see a new high of the day. That breakout is slapped down like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/entertainment/will-smith-chris-rock/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Rock at the Oscars</a> and the long red bearish engulfing candle signals a likely reversal. Sellers push the market down to the low of the day. That support holds and the market is able to close higher.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The late day smack down from the high was a sign that sellers are active. The next morning (first day in the chart), we have a gap down below the previous low of the day. AAPL, AMZN and GOOG reported earnings after the close the prior day and the Jobs Report was released before the open. The gap down was instantly gobbled up and the first candle of the day was long and green. The gap was filled instantly and the rally appeared strong. The volume was heavy, but take a close look at the candles. Yes they are green, but did you notice the long tails and wicks? The ranges are huge and there is a lot of retracement into the prior candle. This is a sign of volatility and it is a sign that the move higher is being challenged. At the high of the day we are seeing lots of wicks and that is a sign of resistance. The first long red candle off of the high of the day is a giant warning sign. If buyers were in complete control you would not see one of these. The buy orders would be layered below the current price and when filled they would’ve been replenished if buyers were aggressive. They weren’t that aggressive and that is why long red candles off of a relative high are a warning sign (sellers were able to clear the bid). The market challenges the high of the day once more and it is smacked down. From this point on you should know that the high of the day is in and that you need to favor the short side. By the end of the day, all of the gains are erased and the market closes right where it opened. A good mental exercise is to visualize what this price action might look like on a D1 chart. This is a doji with a very long wick and it is also called a “hang man”. Don’t worry about learning the name, just understand that this pattern is a sign of resistance. The market tried to rally from the opening price and all of the gains were given back. </p>
<p>The next day the market gaps down. It tried to rally and fill the gap, but that effort was squashed. Sellers are still in control and the first candle finished as a bearish hammer. After 90 minutes of trading we can see lots of two sided action and the volume is light. After an onslaught of news, both sides are active and there is no clear direction. This is a low probability trading day.</p>
<p>On the third day the market starts off in a low volume compression. This is an “Inside Day” and there is some “Fed Speak”. What could they possibly say that would make a difference just a few days after the FOMC statement? As it turns out, buyers and sellers were bottled up like genies. The initial rally was incredible, but it quickly reversed. This was a 70 point S&amp;P 500 whipsaw. Buyers prevailed, but the take away is this. Both sides are extremely active and we know that from the volume and the huge moves. It is best for most traders to avoid these conditions. If you trade them, size down and take gains into big moves that are going your way (do not wait for the reversal). Moves like this are impossible to predict. The news was already out the previous week and there was nothing new. Once the first big rally materialized and there were long red candles off of the high of the day, it was natural to expect a reversal. The big reversal was a sign that the volatility would continue. I did not trade this, but if you used 1OP as your guide, you caught these turning points. In this instance, the market could have just compressed on light volume after “Fed Speak”. That is what I would’ve expected. Buyers and sellers were paired off and we knew that from the recent price action. Once we had that initial big move, we could expect big counter moves. This is normally the price action we see after the FOMC statement, not a few days later. </p>

<p>Let’s conclude with one final chart. Unlike the rest, this is a M5 chart and it took place two days after the “Fed Speak” whipsaw. It is critically important to recognize trend days. We have already covered them in great detail in the Market/Technical/Short-term section, but this is when you want to size up and when you want to let your trades run. Set aggressive targets and try to ride your trades as long as possible. The early clues were there. This gap up hit instant resistance and the first 3 candles were red. That is a sign that we could see a “Gap Reversal”. The long red Key Bar was another sign and it established a new low of the day. We can see that there are mixed candles so that is a sign that the trend is not that strong. However, the volume is heavy and there have not been any big bounces. The market methodically filled the opening gap and it took out the prior day’s low. Use 1OP as your guide during trend days. When bullish cycles don’t produce or when you have a bearish divergence, stick with the positions. If the Key Bars are red, stick with short positions as long as the open from those red Key Bars is preserved or until you see a green Key Bar. Have LRSI M5 on the chart (.7 gamma) and as long as the SPY is below 20, stick with shorts. There is a section on the website where I post <a href="https://oneoption.com/annotated-charts/">M5 annotated charts</a>. Spend time there and learn the patterns. </p>
<p>In summary, the daily SPY chart sets the tone and the context for the current day. What does the overnight move look like? Does it breach any key D1 technical levels? You need to determine how this puzzle piece fits into the big picture. Formulate a game plan for each of the possible scenarios that could play out during the day. Know which ones are most likely and which ones present the best trading opportunities. The first few M5 candles will provide valuable clues. Sometimes we can get a good feel for the market direction in the first half hour, sometimes it takes an hour. Wait patiently until you have clarity. Your clarity might not yield a favorable “we are off to the races” conclusion. Most days, that clarity will be that we are in for a choppy light volume move higher where you have to watch for signs of resistance. Your conclusion could also be that we are in for a low volume “Inside Day” where you have to trim your size and your trade count. You must not treat every trading day the same, because they are different. Once you have your bearings, you will know how to plan your day. </p>
