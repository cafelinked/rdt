<h4 class="wp-block-heading">All of the market analysis you have learned to this point is critically important. It will help you to leverage the biggest trading edge I have found in the last 30 years.</h4>
<p>This is the perfect way to conclude the Market section of the course and to transition into the next section. The market accounts for 65% of the trading puzzle and now we are going to put that knowledge to work. </p>
<p>Your opinion of the market and your confidence in that forecast might vary over various time frames. For instance, you could be very bullish long-term, but relatively neutral short term. You could be bullish long-term and bearish short-term. It is important to consider various time frames because your market opinion is going to drive all of your trading decisions. Your short-term trades could look very different from your long-term trades and that is fine. Focus on the trade the duration where you have the greatest confidence in your forecast. There will be periods where you only swing trade with a 1-2 month horizon and periods where you only day trade. Typically, we are somewhere in the middle of that spectrum and we have a mix of both.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out and you are still working on your win rate, you might only be trading stock. You need to throttle your positions based on your market opinion until you get your win rate up. Stock traders who are long-term bullish and short-term bearish will have plenty of spare cash. During a drop, they will watch for signs of support and they start putting that cash to work. If you are trading options, the strategy you select will be determined by your confidence in your market forecast over a specific time period. If you are extremely bullish short term, you are going to favor aggressive strategies like buying ATM call debit spreads. If you are neutral longer-term, you might focus on selling OTM bullish put spreads on strong stocks and selling OTM call spreads on weak stocks. </p>
<p>“Pete how do I determine the right position size?” My response is, “What is your market forecast and how confident are you?” This is the source for every trading decision you make. There is not a magical machine that you can plug numbers into that spits out optimal position size. If it existed, you would need to input your market forecast, the trade duration and your level of confidence. Your position size changes and is not static. Each day, week and month is different and your position size needs to be dynamic. The Professional Poker Player does not bet the same amount every hand. That wager is dependent on their odds of success. </p>
<p>“Pete how do I know when to take profits?” My response is, “What is your market forecast and how confident are you?” If you think the market is vulnerable and you see technical signs of resistance, you start reducing risk. During a bearish trend day, you are confident that the market is going down because you have technical confirmation. You know that there will be bounces along the way and you are prepared to weather them so you let the trade run. You get the idea, so let’s move on.</p>
<p>Stocks that are strong relative to the market are in favor. This is the “tell” that institutions want to own it and we want to follow the “smart money”. This remains the best trading edge I have found during my career. It worked 30 years ago and it works now. We have many ways to find these stocks using Option Stalker and Option Stalker Pro and I can’t wait to show you the next puzzle piece.</p>
<p>The technical patterns you have learned for the SPY will apply to stocks and we will add to those lessons using stock examples.</p>
<p>The market is the single biggest factor in determining your success. If you failed to recognize changing market conditions in December of 2021 and you continued to use the strategies that had been working, you were crushed like a bug when the bear market started. It didn’t matter if you were a great stock picker, they all went down. If 75% of all stocks follow the market and you get the market wrong, your odds of success are low. Let’s end this section on a positive note. If your market forecast is correct, your odds of success will increase dramatically. Now let me teach you how to pick the best stocks so that you can increase those odds even more.</p>
