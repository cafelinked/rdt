<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Day trading the S&amp;P 500 (/ES) is difficult and it takes years to develop this skill. Most traders never get to that point.</h4>
<p>Every trader is drawn to the most liquid futures contract in the world – I was. It’s like “crack” because the tight bid/ask spread reduces slippage and market depth makes it easy to execute large orders. The 30:1 leverage and the absence of Pattern Day Trading (PDT) restrictions lure in traders with small accounts. There are also tax benefits since 60% of your profits can be taken as long term capital gains. So why not just trade the S&amp;P 500 emini?</p>
<p>As the most liquid futures contract in the world, you should know that you are competing with the largest financial institutions. They include proprietary trading companies like Goldman Sachs and Citadel who run buy/sell programs. They spend billions of dollars a year on artificial intelligence (AI) software that analyzes open interest, market depth, volatility, price action and retail trading habits. They also execute arbitrage programs to capitalize on price disparity between the cash and futures markets. Proprietary trading firms have colocation servers with optical readers hosted next to media servers. When a headline hits the “wire” these programs look for key words and they execute large S&amp;P 500 trades in milliseconds. Blink and the futures could move 20 points. Asset Managers use the S&amp;P 500 for hedging and for asset allocation based on inflows/outflows. In short, you are competing with the smartest minds with the deepest pockets in the world. What “edge” do you have against these behemoths? </p>
<p>Does this mean that I don’t ever trade S&amp;P 500 emini? No. I trade it when there are major technical breakouts on heavy volume. You might only get a couple of days in a week where these high probability moves materialize and even then you have to nail your entry and exit. It requires an incredible amount of discipline NOT to trade emini and most people don’t have that. They trade every wiggle and jiggle and they blow their account up quickly on low probability set-ups and headfakes.</p>
<p>Does that mean learning how to day trade S&amp;P 500 is a waste of time? No. In this section, I am going to teach you when to do it and what to watch for. You will be able to identify those high probability opportunities and, more importantly, you will be able to use your knowledge to trade stocks with relative strength/weakness as surrogate positions for the S&amp;P 500. That is where we do have an “edge” that we can trade every day. </p>
