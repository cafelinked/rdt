<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Moves that have lower than average volume can’t be trusted.</h4>
<p>When institutions are active, they trade “size”. If our intent is to follow their trail of bread crumbs, then it is critical for us to watch for heavy volume. When the volume spikes, we know the “smart money” is engaged. The resulting price action reveals if the institutions are in agreement or if they are in opposition.</p>
<p>Trends result when institutions agree on direction. They have the same opinion and they are competing with each other to get the best price. If they are bullish, their intent is always to buy at the best possible price so they are bidding at lower prices and attempting to buy dips. This means that the retracements (downward price movements) are minor because the institutions have big buy orders at lower prices. When they can’t get filled on those orders, they increase their bid price. If they still can’t get filled, they will start to lift offers (buy on the “ask”). In situations where they are aggressively buying, the volume will be heavy and they will “lift” every offer they can. This explains why we see higher lows and higher highs and this concept applies to short and long term time frames.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>In this next example, the price action early in the day is a bit tenuous. The 200-day MA is being tested. Buyers and sellers are jousting. A brief, light volume bounce off of that moving average is easily squashed. Once that support level is breached, the volume increases and institutions are aggressively selling. They want to short and they are offering at higher levels just in case buyers are interested. These offers keep a “lid” on the action and this is why we see lower highs. The sellers are more aggressive than the buyers and we know that because the price is dropping. When the sellers don’t get filled, they start to lower their offers. Eventually, they sense that they are not going to get filled and they hit bids. That results in the next leg lower. Buyers see their orders getting filled on the bid and they see the bearish price action. They reduce their bid size because they feel that they can buy at a lower price. Volume is the key element to this trend. This is all happening on “size” and that tells us that the move is legitimate.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>When we see consecutive stacked candles of a single color with little to no retracement on heavy volume, it is a sign of trend strength. We discussed this in the price pattern section and it is one of the highest probability set-ups we have. If the candles are green, the price is moving higher. The candles stack because the “feeding frenzy” is on. There is little retracement (very few wicks/tails) because the bids are progressively placed just below the current price. Buyers do not feel there will be any chance to get filled at a lower price. They won’t wait long for that order to get filled. They are aggressive and THEY WANT IN!! They will start to buy at the ask to get filled. Not all of the buying is to open a new position. Often times, material news is released and institutions who are short need to buy back the shorts. In the example below, the market was waiting for “Fed speak” and you can see the reaction to the news.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>When institutions are aggressive and the price action heats up, they will eventually stop chasing. How do we know when they have stopped? First of all, the price action during a rally will tell us how anxious they are to take a position. If the candles have overlap and there is retracement into the previous candle we know that the trend strength is moderate. Buyers will not lift offers and they will only buy on a pullback. Short term, bullish traders who have gains from lower levels will exit longs, and that selling will create a light volume pullback. Again, volume is the key. In the example below, the market gapped down on the open and it found support immediately. The gap started to fill on strong volume and then the bounce stalled. During the pullback, you can see how the volume declined. At lower levels, buyers were interested once again and the market made a higher low. You can see how the volume gradually started to increase and the SPY started to climb. This was a sign that buyers were back. If the volume on the pullback had been heavy, the SPY could have continued to drop and the low of the day might have been tested. Traders needed to watch for that heavy volume on the pullback. When it failed to materialize, it was a sign that a buy was setting up.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>When we see light volume moves that go against the longer term trend, we should recognize that there is not a lot of conviction behind the move. In the chart above, the light volume dip is likely to reverse. The trend during the day was up and we would only short if the dip had come on heavy volume. The price had dropped to a level where bulls were interested, and the volume increased when they bought. This told us the rally was going to resume.</p>
<p>There are times when the volume is high and the price does not move. Instead, it is trapped in a very wide range and we see long mixed candles and long wicks/tails with lots of retracement. This typically happens before a big move. Buyers and sellers are battling it out and we do not know who will prevail. This could happen after a major news release or at the extremes of a trading range. If the extreme is a relative low, buyers could win and the market bounces or sellers could win and the market continues lower. In the case of an extreme at a relative high, the market could continue the rally or it could form a top and decline. In the chart below we had the reaction to the FOMC statement. The price action was wild and we did not know which way the market was going to go into the closing bell. The direction was clear the next morning.</p>

<p>The next point is important and it is often a source of confusion. Light volume rallies are NOT bearish and light volume declines are NOT bullish. They are just resting points for the market, and these moves can continue for much longer than you might think. A light volume rally could gain momentum and volume at any time so do not short prematurely. A light volume decline could also gain momentum and volume so do not buy prematurely. Light volume means light volume. Institutions are indifferent at this price level and they are not active. </p>
<p>Here’s where traders get into trouble. Let’s suppose the longer term trend is down and we get a light volume bounce. Bearish traders will ignore a light volume bounce and they will try to weather the move on the notion that this is only a bounce. They are confident that it will soon run its course and that they will be right back on track when sellers return. The light volume tricks them into canceling/ignoring stops. The bounce lasts longer than they expected and it runs much higher than they expected. At some point they will get flushed out for a large loss. Even though the bounce is taking place on light volume, you still have to respect it. The fact that the market was able to rally through a resistance level tells you that sellers are no longer there. Short covering can fuel the move higher. There are instances where new information changes the backdrop. Buyers start supporting the bounce on heavy volume. You let the stop get away from you and now the losses are mounting quickly. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>In the case where you have a longer term bearish trend and a light volume bounce, watch key resistance levels. If they hold you can stick with the position. You do not want to see long green candles that retrace recent red candles. That is a sign that the selling pressure is starting to wane and there is more upside. Take your gains on shorts and let the light volume bounce continue its course. Eventually that move will run out of steam. You know the bounce is all fluff because it has no “teeth” (volume). When you see a technical breakdown (trendline or horizontal support) or key price patterns off of a relative high (bearish hammer or bearish engulf), you know that a short is setting up. Now you just need increasing volume for confirmation. In the chart above, the longer term trend was down. The light volume bounce ran 10% and traders who did not respect it took a beating. Not many traders can weather a move of that magnitude or duration. Eventually, the market did drop and the volume was heavy.</p>
<p>Can you trade in the direction of a light volume move that goes against a longer term trend? Seasoned traders can, but novices should not. You need to trade smaller size and you need to take gains quickly. At any time the rug can get pulled out from under you. Seasoned traders will recognize the technical warning signs that the move is ending and they will pivot on a dime. Novice traders will be blind-sided when the move comes. They will be managing losing positions instead of focusing on new positions that will put them back on the right side of the longer term trend.</p>

<p>There will be times when the volume is light and the market is trapped in a tight horizontal compression. That is an immediate red flag to trim your size and your trade count. Neither side is interested and the market is going to chop around. This is a low probability backdrop. </p>

<p>Heavy volume tells us that institutions are active. The price action will help us gauge the momentum. Stacked, consecutive, long candles with little retracement on heavy volume are the ultimate sign of trend strength. Heavy volume in a wide range tells us that a big move is coming. A breakout in either direction will have follow through. Light volume moves against a longer term trend need to be respected. Let them run their course and watch for signs of exhaustion. When the longer term trend resumes, the volume will return and you should be ready to join that move. Preserve your capital and avoid flat markets with low volume. </p>
