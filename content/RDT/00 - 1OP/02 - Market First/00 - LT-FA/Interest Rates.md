## Interest Rates

### Key Concepts
- **Central Banks & Monetary Policy**: Central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, control interest rates, heavily influencing market trends.
- **Impact on Economy**: Interest rates affect corporate borrowing, consumer spending, and investment decisions. 
- **Historical Low Rates**: Loose monetary policy of the last decade has led to a parabolic market rally.

### Introduction
- **Key Central Banks**: The **Federal Reserve (US)**, **European Central Bank (ECB)**, **People’s Bank of China (PBOC)**, and **Bank of Japan (BOJ)** are major central banks globally. The **US dollar** is the global reserve currency, which places the **Federal Reserve (Fed)** at the forefront of interest rate analysis.
- **FOMC**: The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times annually to set monetary policy, impacting long-term interest rates and major market movements.
### Economic Impact of Interest Rates
- **Corporate Borrowing**: Lower interest rates reduce corporate borrowing costs, potentially increasing profits. This influences market performance.
- **Consumer Behavior**: Interest rates also affect consumer borrowing and spending, further impacting economic activity.
- **Investment Impact**: Interest rates influence the attractiveness of **fixed income investments** (like bonds) relative to stocks. Lower rates push investors towards equities due to less appealing bond yields.
### Monetary Policy of the Last Decade
- **Loose Monetary Policy**: A decade of low interest rates has resulted in corporate share buybacks and consumer spending increases. This monetary environment fueled the stock market rally.
- **Cheap Debt for Corporations**: With low borrowing costs, companies issued debt for capital expenditure or share buybacks, reducing outstanding shares by 50% and boosting **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** without increasing production.

> [!note] **Loose Monetary Policy Consequences**
> The availability of cheap capital led to massive corporate share buybacks and higher consumer borrowing, but also left many households without sufficient savings, as seen during the **Covid-19 pandemic**.
### Investment Landscape in Low-Rate Environment
- **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Over the past decade, stocks have been the preferred investment due to low bank interest rates and negative real returns on 10-year bonds (yield lower than inflation).
- **Investor Behavior**: Even conservative investors, like retirees, have been forced into stocks due to the poor returns on bonds and savings accounts.
### The Effects of Rate Hikes
- **Initial Market Reaction**: When the Fed begins raising rates, markets often react negatively. Asset managers fear that higher rates could stifle economic growth, prompting them to reduce risk by selling stocks. This pattern occurred after the December 2015 rate hike, leading to a **15% market retracement** within six months.

> [!important] **Market Sensitivity to Fed Actions**
> The market is sensitive to rate hikes due to its reliance on easy money. As of 2022, the Fed has raised rates by 0.75%, with plans for further hikes. This has resulted in a **20% market correction**, particularly affecting tech stocks.
### Long-Term Impact of Rate Hikes
- **Gradual Tightening**: Historically, gradual rate increases with strong economic support have led to significant market rallies.
- **Inflationary Periods**: While markets can rise during inflation, **real returns** (adjusted for inflation) tend to be lower compared to periods of normal inflation (2-3%).

> [!tip] **Inflationary Influence**:
> The Fed hikes rates to combat inflation, but rate hikes due to inflation rather than economic growth have distinct effects on the market.
### Loose Monetary Policy & Market Rally
- **Low Volatility & High Liquidity**: The past decade’s loose monetary policy created a safety net, with the system flush with cash. This supported a **massive market rally** and historically low volatility.
- **Short-Term Traders**: Traders need to monitor **FOMC statements/minutes**, which are released during market hours and can cause large market swings.

Interest rates, controlled largely by central banks like the Federal Reserve, influence corporate borrowing, consumer spending, and investment behaviors. A decade of loose monetary policy has fueled significant market growth through corporate share buybacks and high consumer borrowing. However, as the Fed begins to raise rates to combat inflation, markets tend to react negatively, as seen with a 20% correction in 2022. Long-term gradual tightening can lead to rallies, but inflation-adjusted returns during high inflation are typically lower than in periods of normal inflation. Understanding the dynamics of interest rates is essential for traders and investors, particularly with significant events like FOMC meetings influencing market volatility.
