## Credit

### Key Concepts
- **Credit Crises**: A credit crisis is the most significant market threat, with the potential to cause prolonged market declines.
- **Central Banks**: Central banks, like the Federal Reserve (US), control lending, print money, and set interest rates, maintaining global financial stability.

### Introduction
- **Stable Credit Conditions**: Vital for market stability. Economic downturns and other crises come and go, but a **credit crisis** can have long-lasting effects, as seen during 2008-2009. Credit functions as the “oil” of the global financial system.
- **Central Bank Role**: Central banks supervise commercial banks and their lending activities. The **US dollar** is the global reserve currency, accounting for 60% of all international exchange reserves, ensuring the US plays a major role in the global credit system.

### Brief History
- **US National Debt**: In the first 230 years, the US accumulated $2 trillion in debt. This figure has now risen to **$30 trillion**, driven by **mandatory expenses** like Social Security and Medicare, which currently account for 65% of the national budget.
- **Aging Population**: With more **Baby Boomers** retiring, there’s a shift from contributors to beneficiaries, straining government programs. The **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)** projects that in the next decade, mandatory expenses will consume 100% of the budget, leaving no room for other expenditures.

> [!note] **State Debt**
> States such as **New York**, **California**, and **Illinois** face massive structural debt issues, with some of their bonds rated as “junk.”

### Conditions Today
- **Record Consumer Debt**: US consumer credit is at an all-time high, reaching **$4 trillion**. Most Americans are financially over-leveraged, unable to cover expenses for a month without a paycheck.
- **Covid-19 Stimulus**: In 2020-2021, the US government injected $8 trillion into the economy, temporarily preventing a financial collapse during the pandemic. However, this level of stimulus is unsustainable.

> [!important] **Global Context**
> The **US**, while in a better position than many developed nations, is still deeply impacted. For example, **PIIGS nations** (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain) faced debt crises during 2010-2013, requiring ECB-backed bailouts. The US even supported these bailouts through currency swaps, further intertwining global credit systems.

### A Shared World Problem
- **China**: Despite its growth, China’s **central bank** and **shadow banking** industry face rising debt issues, with estimates of **$7 trillion** in municipal debt and **$20 trillion** in unregulated lending. Chinese real estate developer defaults might signal the start of a credit crisis similar to that of 2008-2009.

### When Will a Global Credit Crisis Occur?
- **Timing**: A global credit crisis is inevitable, but predicting its exact timing is difficult. As long as central banks cooperate, they can sustain this system. However, once one central bank falters, others are likely to follow.

> [!tip] **Why Is This Not Publicized?**
> Predicting a credit crisis is unpopular because until it happens, forecasters are dismissed. Political candidates who propose solutions (such as adjustments to Social Security or Medicare) struggle to gain voter support.

### How to Identify a Credit Crisis
- **Private Sector Signs**: If a crisis is contained to **private sector banks**, the market will experience severe declines, offering shorting opportunities. Central banks will intervene to stop contagion.
- **Sovereign Level**: A true credit crisis occurs when **sovereign bond auctions** fail, driving interest rates higher. In the US, constant reissuing of debt creates frequent bond auctions, and when yields rise to high single digits, it's a serious signal.

> [!info] **Safe Havens?**
> In the event of a global credit crisis, banks and brokerage firms will likely freeze assets, and even physical gold may not retain its value. During such crises, governments seize assets, issue new currencies, and impose “haircuts” on deposits above a certain threshold.

### How to Trade a Credit Crisis
- **Shorting Opportunities**: During a credit crisis, shorting the market can be profitable, particularly if the crisis is limited to private banks. However, central banks will attempt to stabilize markets, making it essential to remain cautious.

### Conclusion
The threat of a global credit crisis looms over financial markets, with central banks acting as the last line of defense. While national and consumer debt continues to rise, as long as central banks support each other, the system may persist. However, the inevitable credit crisis is only a matter of time, and understanding the signs, such as bond auctions and banking failures, can help traders prepare. In the meantime, taking care of personal health and relationships remains the most valuable investment during turbulent times.
