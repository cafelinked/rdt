### Summary
Corporate earnings are the backbone of the market’s movement. Mega-cap tech stocks like AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, and MSFT have a significant influence on the S&P 500 due to their size. While certain stocks may rally ahead of earnings, careful trading strategies, such as using bullish put spreads, can capitalize on these movements without holding positions through the earnings release. FactSet provides a valuable resource for monitoring earnings data at the macro level, helping traders and analysts gauge overall market performance.
