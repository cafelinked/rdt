## Economic Reports

### Key Concepts
- **Market Sensitivity**: Economic reports provide data that can cause significant market reactions, especially if the data is unexpected.
- **Release Dates**: Traders should be aware of the release dates for major economic reports to anticipate potential market movements.
---
### Introduction
- **The Bond Pit**: In the late 80s and early 90s, the **US 30-year bond pit** was the only futures market open during economic releases (8:30 AM ET). It was a highly volatile environment where fortunes could be made or lost within minutes, especially around key reports like the **Unemployment Report**.
- **Market Reactions**: Economic releases are typically backward-looking, but when there are significant surprises, they can spark fast market movements.
### Key Economic Reports

#### Unemployment Report
- **Timing**: Released on the **first Friday of every month**.
- **Market Importance**: Wall Street considers this the "grand daddy" of economic releases, but it has limitations due to seasonal adjustments and changes in how long-term unemployment is calculated.
- **Hourly Wages**: A crucial component to monitor during inflationary periods. A rise of **0.6% or higher** in hourly wages indicates significant inflation pressure.
#### Initial Jobless Claims
- **Timing**: Released **weekly on Thursdays**.
- **What It Tracks**: Provides a timely snapshot of unemployment trends. The **4-week moving average** is a good indicator for how the Unemployment Report might come in.
#### ADP Payroll Report
- **ADP**: A private company that processes payrolls for small and medium-sized companies.
- **Accuracy**: Considered more reliable than the government’s jobs report, as it reflects raw data without seasonal adjustments or political influence.
#### ISM Manufacturing and Services Indexes
- **Timing**: Released during the same week as the Unemployment Report.
- **Significance**: These surveys measure **current economic conditions**. Since **80% of US economic activity is in the service sector**, more weight is placed on the **ISM Services** index.
- **Global Context**: With **China** accounting for 30% of global manufacturing, China’s economic data is also closely watched, especially its **GDP, Industrial Production, Retail Sales**, and **PMI**.
#### CPI, PPI, and PCE
- **Inflation Gauges**: These indices track **consumer** and **producer price changes**.
- **Importance During Inflation**: When inflation runs hot, as it is currently, these reports become essential to track, helping traders avoid surprises during swing trades.
#### Retail Sales
- **Consumer Health Indicator**: The **Retail Sales** report gives insight into consumer spending. A **3% growth rate** generally indicates normal spending patterns.

### Conclusion
To effectively trade around economic reports, it’s essential to be aware of their release dates and potential impacts. The goal isn’t to predict the outcome of these reports but to monitor market reactions and adjust positions accordingly. Traders should stay alert to key data points and note when reports generate significant market responses, as these reactions provide valuable context for understanding long-term market trends. Proper awareness of upcoming economic releases helps mitigate risks and adjust overnight exposure when surprises are anticipated.
