## Black Swans

### Key Concepts
- **Black Swan Events**: Unpredictable events that catch investors completely off guard and are not priced into the market.
---
### Introduction
- **Definition**: A **Black Swan event** is an unforeseen occurrence that causes sudden market disruption. These events are rare and unpredictable, and the market cannot price them in advance.
- **Examples**:
  - **9/11**: A sudden and devastating terrorist attack that shocked markets worldwide.
  - **Flash Crash**: A rapid, deep, and temporary market crash, caused by high-frequency trading, occurring over a short period.
  - **Covid-19**: A global pandemic that led to a sharp, sudden market drop as businesses shuttered and economies stalled.
### Not Black Swans
- Events like the **.com tech bubble** and the **2008-2009 financial crash** were not Black Swans. These events were predictable due to factors like inflated stock valuations and unsound lending practices.
### Market Recovery
- Despite the havoc caused by Black Swan events, markets have shown resilience:
  - The market rebounded shortly after **9/11**.
  - The **Flash Crash** corrected within a day.
  - The **Covid-19 drop** lasted only a few months before recovery.

### Conclusion
Black Swan events are rare, unpredictable, and cause sudden market downturns, but they are followed by relatively quick recoveries. While thereâ€™s no way to predict or fully prepare for them, history shows that markets eventually bounce back.
