### A Trader’s Perspective
- **Foreign Markets as Indicators**: Although not central to daily trading strategies, foreign markets can set the tone for the US market by providing either a **head wind** or **tail wind**.
  - **Asian Markets**: China, as the second-largest economy, followed by Japan, has significant weight. Monitoring data such as **Purchasing Manager Indices (PMI)**, **GDP**, **trade balance**, and **retail sales** is crucial.
  - **European Markets**: Monitored during US trading hours. **ECB monetary policy** is especially important as it can impact global financial flows.
- **Daily and Weekly Reviews**: Foreign markets are reviewed **daily** and **weekly** for comparison to the S&P 500, but they are not a major part of fundamental analysis.

> [!note] **Global Exchange Holidays**
> US markets may experience **dull trading sessions** during global exchange holidays, making it essential to be aware of these dates.
### Case Studies
- **Covid-19 Alert in 2020**: In January 2020, early signs of a virus outbreak in China were overlooked by many analysts. However, tracking **empty highways** and developments during the **Chinese New Year** provided early warnings, helping traders prepare for the drop when the S&P 500 fell in February 2020.
- **China’s Market in 2021**: While the US market hit all-time highs, **China’s market** fell by over 20%, raising concerns about global economic health. Signs of stress, such as defaults in **China’s real estate market**, signaled potential global economic issues.

### Conclusion
While foreign markets may not frequently impact daily trading, monitoring major global events and trends can help traders avoid being caught off guard. The US, with its dominant market capitalization and liquidity, remains the primary focus, but global fundamental analysis can provide early warnings of broader economic shifts.
