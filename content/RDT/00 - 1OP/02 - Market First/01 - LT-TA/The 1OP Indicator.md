<h4 class="wp-block-heading">This is a proprietary indicator with unique qualities</h4>
<p>1OP stands for <strong>1OP</strong>tion. As you will see, it does not correlate with other indicators and about 20% of the time it is inversely correlated with the market. Most other technical indicators mimic each other and they lag. In my opinion, that limits their usefulness. 1OP is predictive, not reactive, and that makes it unique. I don’t divulge what 1OP measures or how it is calculated, but I do teach traders how to use it. I use it more for short term trading and it was designed and optimized for day trading the S&amp;P 500. That said, I do use it for confirmation on a longer term basis so I want to introduce it.</p>
<p>Like most indicators it has a fast line (1OP2, default color: red) and a slow line (1OP1, default color: blue). When the fast line crosses the slow line, a trade signal is generated. Under ideal conditions the indicator will have cycles with nice tall peaks and deep troughs. When the indicator is in a deep trough and 1OP2 crosses above 1OP1, a buy signal is generated. When the indicator has a tall spike and 1OP2 crosses below 1OP1, a sell signal is generated. </p>

<p>In the image above you can see the big spikes and deep troughs with nice clean crosses. The market had a nice range and good movement within the range. Notice how the 1OP crosses pinpointed those reversals before they started. The market is fluid and ever changing. Sometimes the trend is strong and other times the market volume is light and the price action is choppy. </p>
<p>When the market is in a strong trend we can tell by the price action. We will see stacked, consecutive candles of a single color on heavy volume. That is when we can expect a divergence. This pattern is particularly useful because it confirms the trend strength. During a bearish 1OP cycle we would expect the market to drop. When 1OP is falling and the market is moving higher, we have a bullish divergence (chart below). This is a sign that the up trend is very strong and that the next bullish cross will be good. Conversely, if we have a bullish cycle and the market drops, we have a bearish divergence. That tells us to trade from the short side and to expect more selling. </p>

<p>When the market is flat during a bullish cycle, we call that “benign”. It will tell us that the next bearish cross is likely to be a good one. It is fairly uncommon for more than two cycles to be benign. When that happens it is a sign of slow market conditions. With each passing cycle that does not produce, the odds of one that does produce increases. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>In this example we have a very long bearish cycle that is benign. The market did not retreat and we should be watching for the bullish cycle to produce. After the bullish cross, the market marched higher. Notice how the 1OP indicator has numerous “mini” crosses. This is a sign of weak trend strength. </p>

<p>There are times when the market price action is poor. Tiny-bodied, mixed candles, tight ranges and low volume are typical under these conditions. When 1OP is tight to the zero line and there are many mini crosses you should not rely on the indicator and you should keep your trading to a minimum. This is a sign that the market trend strength is poor and that a compression is likely.</p>

<p>There is one other important concept to trading 1OP. Remember, it is early/predictive. That means that we need technical confirmation before we take a trade signal. 1OP allows us to prepare for that move. If we are long and we see a bearish cross, we can start taking gains on our long positions and we can start looking for shorts. If we are short and we see a deep drop and a bullish cross, we can take gains on our shorts and we might start considering longs. In the section below we are not going to add technical confirmation, we are just going to look at the 1OP cycles on the SPY using a daily chart. </p>

<p>In the chart above, you can see how well the crosses predicted the next move in the SPY. You can see that there are some mini crosses, but the market was very volatile and there were many mixed candles. In general, 1OP moved well and it had nice ranges.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1OP-d1b-1024x644.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="2b53d3a3-3cee-46d0-b86e-a172609b7891">

                    </div>
                
<p>In the chart above, the 1OP indicator had nice peaks and troughs early and the second red shaded area was a bullish divergence. You can see how the next bullish cross produced a nice rally. The last green shaded area is unusual and we do not typically see extended periods where the indicator is not moving above and below zero. There are many mini crosses and this has been a very long bullish cycle. In the early stages of the bullish cycle the market dropped hard and it looked like a bearish divergence. In the last couple of months the market has bounced and it is almost back to the area where the cycle started. When the indicator is in sync with the market, it is a valuable tool and we can see the big peaks and deep troughs during the cycles. When 1OP has many mini crosses and the indicator does not have nice movement, we have to rely on other forms of technical analysis.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I don’t use 1OP much on a long term technical basis, but it is useful for confirmation. On a longer term basis I lean more on major moving averages and trendlines… because that is what other traders use. 1OP was designed as a short-term indicator and you will see how effective it is for day trading and short term swing trading. As I shift to short term analysis, I lean on 1OP heavily.</p>
