<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There is important supply and demand information within each candle.</h4>
<p>In this article I want to start with some basic concepts. It is much more important to understand the message from each candle than it is to memorize the names of patterns like 3 Crows Flying, Spinning Tops or Abandoned Baby. The chart below will help us understand the basics.</p>

<p>The diagram above is just a couple of colored rectangles to the untrained eye. The open of the candle is the opening price. If the candle closes higher than the open it is green and if the candle closes lower it is red. The key elements to each individual candle are the length of the body and the length of the tails (below the body) and wicks (above the body). </p>

<p>Let’s suppose that the green candle above has the smallest possible body and virtually no tail or wick. A candle with a very tiny body is called a doji. What might a candle like that be telling us? It is a sign that buyers and sellers are in equilibrium. They are paired off and neither side has an advantage. When you see a group of tiny bodied candles consecutively, it is a compression. A breakout from the compression could go either way. The candle on the right in the image above has a relatively long body and it is red. What might it be telling us? At the start of the candle sellers took control. They overpowered buyers and they kept driving the price down. The candle almost closed on its low and that is bearish. How do we distinguish a body that is long, medium or short? We can look at the previous 30 candles and judge them on a relative basis or we can compare the length to the 20-period average ATR (average true range). If the body of the candle is greater than the 20-period ATR I would consider it to be long. Typically, long candles stick out like a sore thumb on a chart. Long bodied candles are important because they reveal that buyers (if green) or sellers (if red) are clearly in control. </p>

<p>The length of the tails (under the body) and wicks (above the body) are also very important. In the case of long tails, sellers were able to drive the price down, but buyers scooped up shares at that level and the stock finished well off of the low for the bar. The opposite is true of long wicks. Buyers were driving the price higher, but at those levels sellers were engaged and they drove the price back down. The stock closed well off of its high for that bar. The left candle in the image above tells us that there is uncertainty and buyers and sellers are battling it out. If the range (high minus low) is greater than the 20-period ATR it tells us that the stock was all over the board. It closed in the middle of the range and we can expect volatility until one side or the other has an upper hand. In the diagram above, the candle on the right has no wick or tail. What does that tell us? If it was a tiny bodied candle, it would be a sign that there was not much of an influence either way. The stock did not move much from start to finish. If that candle body was long relative to other candles, it provides a clear message. The body of the candle is red in this case and it tells us that sellers were in complete control. From the start of the candle to the end if it, they kept hammering bids and the stock was not able to come up for air (no tail). If this candle also had heavy volume you would look for follow through selling in subsequent candles. </p>
<p>Now that we understand the basics for individual candles, we will look at groups of candles in the next article. </p>
