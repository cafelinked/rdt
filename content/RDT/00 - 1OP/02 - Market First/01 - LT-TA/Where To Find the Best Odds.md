<p>Which set-up presents the greatest odds for success? That is the question traders have to answer everyday. We have to determine the possible scenarios that could play out and then we have to devise a game plan around the ones that present the highest probability of success. We might not get the scenarios that favor us, so we have to be patient. As the day unfolds, we know the patterns that would set up those ideal scenarios so that we are ready to act when they present themselves. </p>
<p>During my three decades in the business I’ve witnessed thousands of traders when I was on the brokerage side of the business, I’ve personally experienced the lessons I teach as a professional trader and I’ve watched real-time posts in my chat room during 3 bull markets and 2 bear markets. This has given me very keen insight into how traders think. In general, they are reactive, they lack patience and they have no game plan. We will dive deep into these topics later in the course, but I thought I would conclude this section of the course with an example. </p>
<p>The next four charts represent what some traders in the chat room were thinking from 9/20/24 – 9/26/24 and they are typical. These are M5 (five minute bars) charts with VWAP and the 1OP indicator. The intraday price action was telling them that good shorts were setting up.</p>

<p>After witnessing a number of shorts during this referenced stretch, I decided to write a lesson in lieu of my normal pre-open market comments. The majority of the trades posted in the chat room had been bullish, but I knew there were many traders that needed to take a step back and think about what was happening and how they were trading. </p>
<p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS 9/25/24 – Last week the market broke out to a new all-time high after a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed. Powell said that inflation is within the target range and that part of the dual mandate was to preserve employment. They did not see any pending declines in domestic economic activity and they did not want to wait for that. This is a bullish backdrop for the market.</p>
<p>I mentioned in yesterday’s comments that global economic growth is slowing and that this might be part of their consideration. </p>
<p>From a purely technical perspective, breakouts are nice, but we need to see immediate follow through. If we don’t get that, it could be a sign that the breakout was influenced by triple witching. It is normal for the market to test the breakout and that has taken place the last few days. Yesterday the market probed for support and it jumped off of that low and it closed near the high of the day. This is the type of price action we want to see, but it was NOT accompanied by high volume.</p>
<p>Why is immediate follow through so important? Asset Managers won’t chase stocks at a new all-time high. They will wait to see if there is immediate follow through buying the very next day. That would be bullish and it would be a sign that buyers are very aggressive. They don’t feel like they will have a better opportunity to enter. The news is so good that they don’t wait. This level of buying also keeps sellers sidelined and they hold off for higher prices. This is why we want to see price explode through resistance and we want immediate follow through. Anything less than this is NOT as bullish. It is common for the market to retest the breakout. Asset Managers don’t typically chase new all-time highs and in this case they want to see if the breakout was triple witching related. The retest of the breakout should be brief and shallow because some buyers will be excited to buy a dip. Once support is established, the market will jump off of that low and more buyers will join in on the notion that the breakout was legitimate. In this scenario, buyers are moderately interested and the move higher will be tenuous with plenty of bid checks. A gradual float higher results. I believe this could be the scenario that is playing out.</p>
<p>The bearish scenarios would include no follow through to the breakout. Over time, the selling pressure is too great and buyers put their wallets back in their pockets. The bid softens and a choppy drift lower ensues. Mixed overlapping candles are a sign that the pullback will be brief and shallow. Once support is established, there will be another attempt at the high. The most bearish scenario is a gap up to a new all-time high and a massive gap reversal that same day with a close on the low of the day (bearish engulfing candle). Sellers are smacking every bid in sight and the odds of follow through selling are high. </p>
<p>This is how you read price action. The candles tell a story and I’ve just explained it to you. </p>
<p>I liked the bounce off of the low yesterday, but it came on light volume. The news this week is light and there is not a catalyst. This would be the perfect time for buyers to flex their muscles. “They don’t need no stinkin news” and they want to buy right #$%^ now!! The Fed is dovish and domestic growth is intact. We are NOT seeing this level of excitement so we need to temper our bullish bias. We expect dips and we welcome them. This is going to be a tenuous move higher so as day traders we wait for them. Once the market has formed support, we buy the strongest stocks on our list. We will not be suckered into shorting these market dips intraday because the market just made a new all-time high. We repeat to ourselves, “buy dips, buy dips, buy dips”. If the dip looks particularly daunting… don’t buy. For God’s sake… DO NOT SHORT! It’s OK not to make money, but it is devastating to lose money. </p>
<p>Some of you are <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/trading-realities/rigid-thinkers/">perma fade</a> traders. If the market is going up, you want to short. If the market is going down, you want to buy. Trading against the trend will end your journey. If it helps to keep you from shorting, tell yourself that there will be many opportunities to make money on the short side off of an all-time high ONCE YOU HAVE TECHNICAL CONFIRMATION. Long red candles below the breakout with late day selling on heavy volume will signal that sellers are in control and they are aggressive. Do you see that now? No. Stop shorting. It’s hard to find good shorts and there’s a reason for that. </p>
<p>From a swing perspective, you have starter long positions on. If the market recaptures the all-time high this week on good volume, you can add. I don’t believe we are going to get the volume component of this equation so your swing exposure should be minimal. </p>
<p>Next week’s economic data points will move the market. If the data points are weak, the market will worry that the Fed saw the warning signs and that they acted aggressively to fend off weakness. The market will drop and fear that the Fed waited too long will result in “risk off”. If the economic numbers are good, the market will get the “all clear” confirmation it needs and buyers will return. </p>
<p>Support is at the 50-day MA and resistance is at the all-time high.</p>
<p>That concludes the daily comments I posted and the lesson from 9/25/24. Now let’s zoom out and take a look at what was happening on a longer-term basis. You can see the Cup &amp; Handle breakout and the lackluster price action since the Fed rate cut. The move higher is not overly bullish, but it certainly is NOT bearish. That means that at any point and time, bulls could decide to support the breakout. They might not chase gaps up on the open, but they will buy dips. We need to lean into that likelihood. If the market has dropped and support has been established, the odds of a nice bounce are much greater than the odds of a big move lower. </p>

<p>The chart below shows the referenced time period using M5 bars. Almost every day there was a probe for support (aka bid check). The programs attempt to find that support. No matter how destructive the price action looks at any moment, you have to fend off the urge to short. Your only thought should have been to wait for support and to buy dips. Some days you had to wait an hour or two, but eventually you had your window of opportunity. If you had followed the 1OP bullish crosses you did well. </p>
<p>Not many traders would have shorted the open. They had to wait for signs of weakness and technical confirmation. By the time they got it, the move was almost over and they were exposed to a snap back rally. In the back of their minds they were aware that the market was within striking distance of the all-time high and that shorting was foolish. When the bounce comes they shut the trades down for a loss. They are so preoccupied with managing losing trades that they miss the opportunity to get long.</p>

<p>During this course I will provide you with real examples of what traders go through on a daily basis. This is not just 20/20 hindsight, I have videos and daily market comments that span well over a decade. I started archiving intraday comments in 2022 so you can go back and see what I was saying at the time. </p>
<p>The longer-term market context drives our short-term decision making. In the “heat of the moment” we know the scenarios that present our greatest odds for success. Those ideal set-ups are not always going to present themselves and we have to wait patiently for them to surface. We know the patterns to watch for and we have a plan of action ready. Not every trade is going to work out, but odds are that the vast majority of them will if we use the longer-term context to formulate our short-term game plan and if we patiently wait for the set-ups.</p>
