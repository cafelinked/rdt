<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In this article we are going to continue our analysis of price action for the market on a longer term basis. Please make sure to read Part 1. </h4>
<p>We know from our analysis in the previous article that the market has a negative bias and that the conditions are extremely volatile for swing trades that last 3-4 weeks. We are only going to conduct price action analysis, but in future articles we will use all forms of technical analysis. The hollow candles in the chart are important since they have long bodies, short tails/wicks and relatively heavy volume. I will post the same chart many times so that the points are easier to reference. </p>

<p>13. The market is backing off from a recent high. These mixed candles are fairly long and this is a very wide range. It is a sign of indecision and volatility. A big move is likely.</p>
<p>14. A long red candle transitions us from one range to the next and it appears that sellers have the upper hand. However, we are still seeing giant mixed candles. We can favor the short side since the mid-point of the long red candle that transitioned us from one range to the next is still intact, but this is extreme volatility. Favor the short side, but keep it light. </p>
<p>15. Once again the market has gapped down and a new range has been established at a lower level. We are seeing tails under body and lots of mixed candles. That is a sign of weak trend strength and it is confirmed by the light volume (blue line &lt; 0). We can expect a bounce, so any short positions should be closed. It is way too early to go long. Since the beginning of the chart, the market has dropped 10%. We needed to use a swing trading tactic where we short bounces once they lose momentum and then we take gains and go to cash when we see signs of support. </p>

<p>16. The market bounced off of the low of the year and it filled in a tiny gap. That bounce quickly found resistance and we know that from the compressed range and the mixed candles. The volume on this bounce was very light. The long red candle breached the compression (blue shaded area) on heavy volume. The mid-point held and this was a good area to enter swing shorts.</p>
<p>17. The market bounced off of a new low for the year on light volume and the mid-point of the red candle (16) has been preserved. The market did fill in an earlier gap, but there is still one that has not been filled. Buyers did not have the fire power to do so. The long green candle was immediately erased by a long red candle and sellers are still in control. We should expect follow through and we could test the low of the year. </p>
<p>18. Before the market could test the low of the year, buyers surfaced. The first candle is a doji and it does not present any problem. The next two candles are a bit more bullish. In both instances, the market opened below the prior close (gap down) and then the candle closed on the high of the day. The market also closed well above the low of the day and it is a sign that buyers are engaged. This could be a higher low double bottom that is forming and bearish swing traders should be taking gains on short positions. </p>
<p>19. The last two green candles have opened below the prior close and they have rallied during the day to close above the opening price. Support is starting to form and this looks like a higher low double bottom. Bearish swing traders should take remaining gains on short positions. It is way too early to get long. We need to have much more confirmation before we consider that. </p>

<p>20. The market has been able to rally off of the low on light volume. The mid-point of the long green candle has been preserved. The market has been down 25% since the start of the year and that should keep us in a bearish mode. The bounce did not get very far and we are seeing a compression. </p>
<p>21. During this breakout we are seeing overlapping candles and that is a sign of weak trend strength. Each of these green candles started the day in negative territory. Sellers tested the bid early and buyers were able to power the market higher. This move feels like it is getting tired, but we do not have any technical confirmation to short. </p>
<p>22. This is a nice gap down from the high. If the gap is preserved for a few days it will be a sign that buyers do not have enough power to fill it and that will set up a good shorting opportunity. </p>

<p>The last bar on this chart is significantly lower than the first bar. The market has been very weak and this is officially a bear market (down more than 20%). A bearish opportunity could be setting up as we continue our price action analysis in the next article. </p>
