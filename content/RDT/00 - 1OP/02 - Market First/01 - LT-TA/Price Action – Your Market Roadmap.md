<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How we get from point A to point B helps us determine where point C is and how we will get there.</h4>
<p>Price action describes the journey from point A to point B. Did we take a high speed jet in a straight line or did we take a motorhome with many side trips along the way? Many traders get hypnosis when they look at charts and all they see are random green and red rectangles. I hope that this metaphor gets you in the right mindset because learning how to read price action is critically important. This skill will replace most, if not all, of the technical indicators you use. Our goal is to put the current price action into the longer term context so that we can predict how long it will take us to get to point C and how we will get there. In some cases we will deduce that we can’t predict where point C is, and that is also useful information.</p>
<p>If I am observing a journey from LA to Chicago that started a few hours ago, I would deduce that we are probably in a jet because the path is direct and there is only one mode of transportation that could get us there that quickly. If the last stretch of the journey to Chicago took place at the same speed, I would be able to continue that straight line and predict possible destinations with a high degree of accuracy. When the speed between two points starts to decelerate and we lose altitude we could be getting close to the end of the journey. In the case below, the flight might be headed towards New York.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, I will only be referencing bullish price action, but the same principles apply to bearish trades. A stock that makes the journey above would have long green candles stacked consecutively with little to no overlap. That is the fastest and most direct way to get from point A to point B. The volume and momentum tell us that we are traveling at a high altitude. Jets (and stocks with this pattern) don’t depart from their path and that makes it easier for us to predict direction. &nbsp;This pattern of stacked consecutive candles with little to no overlap is powerful and this formation typically leads to a sustained move. </p>

<p>If I am observing a different journey from Sawtooth (A) to Devil’s Tower (H), I notice that the speed is much slower and that there have been a number of right angle turns. I might deduce that this is ground travel, but the direction from point H is uncertain. Our job is to predict the next destination in a journey with accuracy. I can’t do that with any degree of certainty, so I would take a pass. </p>

<p>If we found a similar journey for the SPY, it might look like the chart below. You would see mixed green and red candles with lots of retracement and low volume. There is no directional momentum and it is very difficult to predict where the SPY is going to go next. That means we should tread very cautiously. There may be short periods of time in this journey where we can predict the movement, but we had better not overstay our welcome.</p>

<p>The goal for this article was to change your mindset. Stop looking at the candles as green and red rectangles and start looking at them as a roadmap. The travel pattern that got you to this point is likely to continue and it will determine our ability to predict the next leg of the journey. We want nice tight, orderly price action because that tells us that institutions are active. This pattern makes it easy for us to predict future price movement. We can’t predict the flight of a bat and we don’t even try to because we’ve been able to observe it. On the other hand, we can predict the flight of a flock of geese in a tight “V” formation. That is what we search for.</p>
