<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Breakouts can look very convincing, but time will tell the true nature of the move. Here’s what to look for. </h4>
<p>On November 10<sup>th</sup> the market had a breakout above a downward sloping trendline, above the 100-day MA and above a horizontal resistance level. This was a reaction to a “lighter than expected” CPI and the breakout came on heavy volume. The market has been in a longer term bearish trend. That context is very important because the move could have been caused by short covering.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Why do we care if it was short covering?</h6>
<p>Short term traders do not have staying power. They are in and out of positions and they are trying to capture short term moves. If this was short covering, the breakout could easily fail as that buying dries up. For a sustained move higher we want long term buyers. If Asset Managers feel that the market will be trading higher than this level a year from now, they will start to scale in on the notion that seasonal strength with fuel a year-end rally. Under-allocated Asset Managers will get nervous that they missed a nice entry point and they will buy this breakout.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">How will we know if Asset Managers are buying?</h6>
<p>After a nice breakout through multiple resistance levels we will see small dips and increasing volume on rallies. The mid-point of the long green November 10<sup>th</sup> candle could be tested, but that retest will be gobbled up immediately. Then we will see follow through buying on good volume and the bounce will have follow through immediately (2-3 days).</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Why does the follow through have to happen immediately?</h6>
<p>It is a sign that buyers are aggressive. They do NOT believe they will have a better opportunity to enter and they do NOT want to miss this entry point. They will layer bids at lower levels, but when they are not filled they will start to raise the bid. That process fuels the move higher and the feeding frenzy is on.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">What happens if we do not see follow through buying and the volume dries up?</h6>
<p>If the market can’t add to the gains it will be a sign that the November 10<sup>th</sup> breakout was just a short covering bounce to squeeze short term traders (this includes trading institutions). It would be a sign that Asset Managers are NOT aggressive and that they do NOT feel like this is the last chance to buy stocks at this level. Traders will recognize that there is no follow through and that the volume is light. They will recognize this as a short covering bounce and they will get more aggressive with their shorts.</p>

<p>We did not see follow through buying. Instead we had tight ranges on light volume with a bearish bias. This tells us that Asset Managers are not buying aggressively and that the chance for follow through is unlikely. The breakout was likely just short covering and traders/institutions will get more aggressive trading from the short side.</p>
<p>This morning the SPY will open just above major technical support at $390. That support will be tested. Buyers want to see a heavy volume bounce off of that level and they want to fill the gap quickly this morning. The SPY needs to close above the close from Wednesday. Shorts want to see a wimpy, light volume bounce on the open with mixed overlapping candles. That will be a sign that the bounce is going to reverse quickly and that the move is weak. A gap and go lower with stacked red candles through $390 would be bearish.</p>
<p>Swing traders were stopped out of the long position yesterday for no gain when the SPY closed below $396. If you sold bullish put spreads, we need to see the bullish scenario above play out to stick with the positions. If the SPY closes below $390 today you need to close those spreads out.</p>
<p>Day traders should watch $390 this morning. Given the price action the last week, I suspect that this breakout is going to fail. If it does and the volume starts to increase, focus on the short side.</p>
<p>Support is at $390. Resistance is the close from Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
