<p>Horizontal support and resistance levels are easy to spot on a daily chart. Longer term horizontal levels with many touches are more significant than shorter term horizontal levels with only a few touches. Traders lean on these levels and that makes them significant. </p>
<p>If the market has been above a horizontal support level, traders will assume that it will not be breached, especially if it is above all of the major moving averages as well (sign of strong trend). As the market drifts down to horizontal support, look for mixed, overlapping candles in this scenario. That will be a sign that the trend strength is weak on the way down. Ideally, the horizontal support level will not even be touched. That would be a sign that buyers are eager to buy at that level and they don’t want to risk missing the bounce so they error on being early. Tails under the body of the candle will be a sign that buying pressure is building. </p>

<p>In the chart above, the market had been in a very strong long-term uptrend. Once that horizontal support was confirmed, it rebounded quickly. The previous high serves as horizontal resistance. The stacked consecutive green candles with little to no overlap suggest strong trend strength and that previous high is going to be attacked. Notice how the market blew through the previous high on the first attempt. One brief retest of the breakout through resistance and it was off to the races. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Case_Studies_Testing_Support_Resistance">Case Studies: Testing Support &amp; Resistance</h2>
<p>When the market tests horizontal resistance with mixed overlapping candles it is a sign that the attack on that level is weak. It is not likely to have the fire power it needs to get through. This is often the case if the market has had to travel far to reach that resistance level. If multiple attempts can’t force a breakout, it is a sign that the selling pressure is building. In the chart below you can see how the market eventually backed off and it took a running start at the resistance level. The stacked green candles looked impressive, but they barely broke through resistance. The breakout is important, but so is the follow through. In this case there wasn’t any. A brief compression above the breakout and the market rolled right over. That breakout was a head fake. Traders who bought the new high were about to get flushed out.</p>

<p>Let’s continue to reference the chart above. This was actually a market transition and we can see the first signs that a long-term trend is about to reverse. Off of that failed breakout, the selling pressure was heavy. We can see that from the stacked red candles and the breach of horizontal support on the first attempt. There was immediate follow through. After a very long uptrend, buying dips had been a successful strategy and buyers were not going to throw in the towel so quickly. The bounce was violent, but sellers returned and now we will shift our focus to horizontal resistance. </p>

<p>Let’s continue to reference the chart above. We can see that the selling pressure is persistent and that horizontal resistance is forming. We can also see that horizontal support has formed and that it is being tested with greater frequency. The market is transitioning from a 12-year raging bull market to a bear market and we are witnessing extreme volatility as buyers and sellers do battle. This battleship will be hard to turn and buyers have not thrown in the towel yet. Sellers are also flexing their muscles and a large range between horizontal support and resistance has formed. At either extreme, there is no follow through at this stage.</p>
<p>Eventually, the sellers win and horizontal support is attacked with stacked red candles. That support failed easily and the downtrend continued. This low officially put the SPY in bear market territory after a 12-year bull market. In the chart you will notice a blue shaded area. This is called a compression and it is the next topic we need to cover. </p>

<p>Compressions are very tight ranges with defined horizontal support and resistance. They are a sign that buyers and sellers are in equilibrium. The longer and tighter the compression, the bigger and more sustained the breakout. With regards to the market, we do not want to trade compressions. This is a time to be passive. Wait for the breakout and follow through. Once we know the direction, the move is likely to be sustained. In Option Stalker Pro you can see compressions on the chart using the 1OSqz indicator. Grey dots mean that the market is moving normally. Yellow dots mean that the market is compressing. Green and red dots signal a big breakout from the compression. We can spot the compressions easily on a SPY chart, but we can use Custom Search to find them for stocks. Once we identify them, we drop horizontal alerts lines above the compression and below the compression so that we know when there is a breakout. </p>

<p>Long green and red candles can also mark horizontal support and resistance levels. They are less common on a daily chart, but when you have them you should watch what happens after they have formed. In general, the long candle forms because the price action in that direction has been very steady. A long green candle indicates steady buying all day long. The SPY opened on its low and closed near its high. A long red candle indicates steady selling pressure. The SPY opened near its high of the day and closed near its low. These long candles lose their relevance quickly and they are used more in analyzing price action during the next few bars.</p>

<p>The open of a long green candle is significant because that was where buyers were excited. They came in and supported the market all day. If that open fails, it is a sign that the buyers at that level have been exhausted and that this horizontal support level has failed. The half-way point of that long green candle is significant, but less so. </p>
<p>The open of a long red candle is significant because that is where sellers were excited. They unloaded the SPY all day. If the market rallies above the open from that long red candle it is a sign that sellers at that level have been exhausted and that this horizontal resistance level has failed. The half-way point of the long red candle is significant, but less so. It does provide valuable price action information so we will discuss it later in that section. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Horizontal support and resistance levels are important on longer term and shorter term time frames. They are easy to spot, and how the market approaches those levels is more important than the level itself. If resistance is attacked with stacked consecutive long green candles, we are likely to blow through it. If the move from the recent low covers a lot of territory and the candles are mixed and overlapping, resistance is likely to hold. Even if the market breaks through horizontal resistance, we still need to see follow through in the next few bars. That continuation confirms the breakout. Heavy volume on a breakout also legitimizes the move. Price compressions are a sign of equilibrium. Wait for a breakout and confirmation and expect follow through. The longer and tighter the compression, the bigger and more sustained the breakout. </p>
