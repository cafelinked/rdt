<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Trendlines are constructed by connecting the highs or lows on a chart. They are easy to spot on a chart and traders rely on them when they devise their trading game plan. That makes them relevant.</p>
<p>Let’s define some terms so that it is easier to talk about trendlines. There are 4 types of trendlines that we look for. This verbiage is not an industry standard, but they are terms I use. The first word indicates what we are connecting. All trendlines we are either connecting <strong>Highs</strong> from a bar or they are connecting the <strong>Lows</strong> from a bar. The <strong>(+)</strong> indicates an ascending (rising) trendline and a <strong>(-)</strong> indicates a descending (declining) trendline.</p>
<p>Here’s why we need different terms. There are bullish ascending trendlines where we look for breakouts (<strong>High+</strong>) and there are bearish ascending trendlines where we look for breakdowns (<strong>Low+</strong>). There are breakouts, breakdowns and fakes. If I told you that stock XYZ had an ascending (up trend) breakout, that could be bullish (<strong>High+</strong>) or bearish (<strong>Low+</strong>). If I told you that stock XYZ had an uptrend trendline fake, that could be bearish (<strong>High+</strong>) or bullish (<strong>Low+</strong>). In the chat room we post trading set-ups and it is critical for us to communicate efficiently. When we mention that stock XYZ had a <strong>High+</strong> <strong>Top</strong> you will be able to instantly visualize that set-up without even looking at a chart. Let’s define some terms.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="High_">High-</h2>
<p>These trendlines connect the “highs” and the trendline slopes downward (descending). When that trendline is broken, it will often signal that a trend reversal is likely. Breakouts above the trendline are “contra” to the prevailing trend. If the breakout was just a little “dead cat” bounce and the stock continues lower we would call that a “<strong>High- Fake</strong>” when the stock drops back below the trendline. Don’t worry if you can’t visualize this right now. There will be plenty of examples.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Low_">Low+</h2>
<p>These trendlines connect the “lows” and the trendline slopes upwards (ascending). When the trendline is broken, it will often signal that a trend reversal is likely. Breakouts below the trendline are “contra” to the prevailing trend. If the stock breaches the trendline on a little profit taking and then resumes the uptrend, we call it a “<strong>Low+ Fake</strong>” when it gets back above the trendline. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="High__3">High+</h2>
<p>These trendlines connect the “highs” and the trendline slopes upwards (ascending). They are less common than a <strong>High-</strong> because they are chasing after an uptrend. When the highs are connected, the line is often moving away from price, not towards it like <strong>High-</strong>. In general, these upside breakouts tend to be a little less reliable because the breaches often happen near the end of the move (buying climax). For that reason, we want to watch for “<strong>High+ Tops</strong>” as a possible sign of a top and a trend reversal.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Low__4">Low-</h2>
<p>These trendlines connect the “lows” and the trendline slopes downwards (descending). They are less common than a <strong>Low+</strong> because they are chasing after a downtrend. When the lows are connected, the line is often moving away from price, not towards it like <strong>Low+</strong>. In general, these downside breakouts tend to be a little less reliable because the breaches often happen near the end of the move (selling climax). For that reason, we want to watch for failed breakdowns as a possible sign of a trend reversal. If the stock breaks down and then crosses back above the trendline, we call this a “<strong>Low- Bottom</strong>“.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Breakout">Breakout</h2>
<p>Typically when a stock penetrates a price point, traders refer to it as a breakout. They use this universally (up or down) and this use is not efficient. For our purposes, a breakout signifies that the stock is moving higher. Since the market goes up more often than it goes down, it makes sense that this word is usually associated with a bullish (upside) event. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Breakdown">Breakdown</h2>
<p>We use this term when the stock falls below a price level. The suffix “down” immediately tells us that this is a bearish event because the stock is moving lower. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="High_Fake">High- Fake</h2>
<p>We use this term to signify that a <strong>High-</strong> breakout was a headfake to lure in bullish speculators. The stock fell right back below the down trendline and the selling has resumed. These patterns are rare and they typically happen when the stock is testing a long term downtrend. Traders are aware of the trendline and they are anxious to buy when it is breached. They enter on that breakout and it fails immediately. The selling pressure created when bullish speculators are flushed out drives the stock below the trendline. This pattern is not common for the same reason that <strong>High+</strong> breakouts are less common. Once the stock breaks out above the downward sloping trendline, it will be harder and harder for it to catch the trendline because it is moving lower. In a matter of days, it will be out of reach. Just because this pattern does not happen often, it doesn’t mean that it is not relevant. Selling pressure has been confirmed and a <strong>Low+</strong> could be close (chart below). If you can search for a High- Fake and a Low+ breakdown that are days apart, you have a very powerful pattern. </p>

                    </div>
                
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Low_Fake">Low+ Fake</h2>
<p>We use this term to signify that a <strong>Low+</strong> breakdown was a head fake to lure in bearish speculators. The stock popped right back above the upward sloping trendline and buyers have returned. These patterns are rare and they typically happen when the stock is testing a long term up trendline. Traders are aware of the trendline and they are anxious to short when it is breached. They enter on that breakdown and it reverses immediately. The buying pressure created when bearish speculators are flushed out drives the stock back above the trendline. This pattern is not common for the same reason that <strong>Low-</strong> breakdowns are less common. Once the stock breaks down below the upward sloping trendline, it will be harder and harder for it to catch the trendline because it is moving higher. In a matter of days, it will be out of reach. Just because this pattern does not happen often, it doesn’t mean that it is not relevant. Buying pressure has been confirmed and a <strong>High-</strong> could be close. See if there is a longer term wedge pattern that has formed. If you can search for a <strong>Low+ Fake</strong> and a <strong>High- Breakout</strong> that are days apart, you have a very powerful pattern.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="High_Top">High+ Top</h2>
<p>When a stock breaks out (going higher) through an upward sloping trendline, that is bullish. However, we know that this breakout could be getting close to a buying climax. The stock has had to run hard and it has been difficult for this trendline to catch-up. Just by nature of this pattern, much of the rally could be exhausted. If the stock falls back below that trendline, there is a good likelihood that a top is forming and that is why we prefer this description. </p>

<p>When a stock breaks down (falling) through a downward sloping trendline, that is bearish. However, we know that this breakdown could be getting close to a selling climax. If the stock rallies back above that trendline, there is a good likelihood that a bottom is forming. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="High_vs_High_">High- vs High+</h2>
<p>Both of these trendlines are trying to catch bullish breakouts. The <strong>High-</strong> Is connecting the highs and the slope is negative. That means these trendlines are driving into the price of the stock and they are likely to intercept it if the price just stops going down. On the other hand, the <strong>High+</strong> is trying to catch a train that has already left the station. It takes a very long time for these trendlines to intercept price so they are less common than the <strong>High-</strong>. Think of it this way. If a stock finds support and it goes sideways, a <strong>High-</strong> will eventually intercept the stock price. It is on a collision course. On the other hand, the <strong>High+</strong> will keep moving higher, distancing itself from the stock when it goes flat. In the chart below you can see how early the <strong>High-</strong> is and how late the <strong>High+</strong> is in catching that move. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="How_Trendlines_Form">How Trendlines Form</h2>
<p>Upward sloping trendlines that connect the <strong>lows</strong> are also called <strong>Low+</strong> trendlines and they are a sign that buyers are engaged. Every time the stock pulls back, buyers are eager to buy shares and the stock can’t get back to that prior horizontal support level before it is scooped up. The “trend is your friend” and you always want to join that longer term tailwind. The longer and tighter the trendline, the better. Tight, orderly trendlines are a sign that buyers are aggressive. Every time that sellers exit, that order is immediately “gobbled up”. Consequently, you do not see any dips and the trend forms. Trendlines will help you avoid picking “tops”. We do not attempt shorts until we have technical confirmation that the <strong>Low+</strong> trendline has been breached. When these ascending trendlines are breached, they are often a sign that the uptrend could be changing. How that trendline is breached often determines if the up trend is ready to reverse. The trendline needs to be attacked with long red candles and heavy volume, and follow through is critically important. In the left side of the chart below, you can see how the SPY is bought before it can even test the trendline. On the right side you can see that the <strong>Low+</strong> trendline was attacked with a long red candle that closed on its low. That is a nice “clean” breach and the follow through selling legitimized it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Downward_Sloping_Trendlines">Downward Sloping Trendlines</h2>
<p>Downward sloping trendlines that connect the <strong>lows</strong> and that have a <strong>negative slope</strong> are called <strong>Low-</strong>. When they are breached to the downside, they are bearish. These descending trendlines that connect the lows are not as reliable for shorting breakdowns as the upward sloping <strong>Low+</strong> trendline breaches that connect the lows. That downside breach is often a selling climax and the stock reverses back above those downward sloping trendlines. In the chart below, you can see how the breakdown below the descending trendline that connects the lows represented a selling climax and the SPY bounced right back above it. </p>

<p>Downward sloping trendlines that connect the <strong>highs</strong> are a sign of selling pressure. They have a negative slope and they are called <strong>High-</strong>. Sellers are eager to unload shares and the bounces can’t get back to the previous high (horizontal resistance). When these downward sloping trendlines are breached to the upside it could be a sign that the trend is about to reverse and it is bullish. How that trendline is breached often determines if the trend is going to change and we will discuss this in detail. Upside breakouts for descending trendlines that connect the highs (<strong>High-</strong>) are much more reliable than breakouts above an upward sloping trendline that connects the highs (<strong>High+</strong>). In the chart below, you can see how the downward sloping trendline that connects the highs is breached convincingly with a gap up and a long green candle that closes on its high. The next day, we had follow through buying and that confirmed the breakout. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Upward_Sloping_Trendlines">Upward Sloping Trendlines</h2>
<p>Upward sloping trendlines (ascending) that connect the highs are called <strong>High+</strong>. Those breaches are not as reliable for buying as the downward sloping trendlines that connect the highs. The trendline is chasing the trend and the highs when connected are often moving away from price, not towards it. Often the upward sloping trendline breach results in a buying climax and the stock quickly falls back below it. These “over and back” crosses (<strong>High+ Top</strong>) are worth keeping an eye on because they could be signaling a trend reversal or a “top”. </p>

<p>Large institutions draw trend lines using algorithms. They know the key price points to draw from and they monitor trendline breaches knowing that activity is likely to increase around those levels. The price action around those breaches is important. Sometimes we see trendline breaches that gain momentum after the breach and sometimes they quickly reverse. It is important to wait for confirmation (follow through) when trading trendlines breaches to avoid false breakouts. Each institution has its own code and often when stocks break a price point, other trendlines with different starting points will also be breached. In January of 2023 Option Stalker Pro will introduce our algo lines and you will be able to see the relevant lines on the chart. We will only use D1 trendlines, but they will be displayed on intraday charts if they are in view.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Steep_Trendlines">Steep Trendlines</h2>
<p>Steep trendlines are less reliable in terms of trading breakouts because they are easily breached. Imagine a stock that has plunged 30% in a matter of days. A move of that nature is going to have plenty of retracement and every little bounce will penetrate a down trendline. A very steep trendline does indicate that the momentum in that direction is likely to continue longer term and it could produce a bearish flag formation so watch for a very short term trendline breach like the one in the chart below. Nice gradual trendlines with no more than a 45 degree angle are more reliable. They tend to stay intact longer and they produce better reversals on the breakouts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Price_Action_Trendlines">Price Action &amp; Trendlines</h2>
<p>Orderly price action is always preferred to choppy price action. We want charts that start a trend and then continue it for at least a few weeks. The candles should be of a similar color and have minimal overlap and minimal retracement. The more touches a trendline has, the more significant it is. I prefer to have at least one touch point towards the middle of the trendline versus two touches right at the start of a trendline. This secondary point serves as confirmation and it validates the trendline. Long term trendlines that match this description are hard to reverse and it is critically important to wait for technical confirmation. In the chart below, you needed to wait for a double top lower high and volume.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Time_Breaches">Time Breaches</h2>
<p>Time breaches occur when a stock has dropped dramatically and a base has formed. As the support continues to hold, the stock will flat line and eventually a downward sloping trendline will be breached. For stocks that have dropped, we prefer a nice bounce off of the base on heavy volume for upside trendline breaches. If the stock breaches the trendline because of time, we consider those to be of low quality. In the chart below you can see how the SPY was compressing in a range and the upward sloping trendlines were breached because of time, not because of heavy selling. This is a low quality breach and it is not trade-worthy. Notice how those breaches took place during a resting point and how the SPY continued higher.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Nested_Trendlines">Nested Trendlines</h2>
<p>Sometimes there will be a trendline within a trendline. The trendline can be in the same direction, but of shorter duration. The longer the trendline and the more touches, the more valid it is. Often a longer term trendline will have a shorter term contra trendline that has formed inside of it. A bullish flag formation would be one example. Traders always want to give the longer term trendline more consideration and that is why bullish flag formations are so reliable. This gives the trader a chance to join the longer term up trend on a pullback and the shorter term downward sloping trendline breach provides an excellent entry point. In the chart below we will look at the opposite pattern where the longer term trend is down. The SPY was not even able to challenge the downward sloping trendline when sellers stepped in. The short term uptrend line (dotted) provided an excellent entry for a bearish position when it was attacked by that long red candle. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Trading_Channels">Trading Channels</h2>
<p>When a trendline that connects the highs runs parallel to a trendline that connects the lows, a trading channel is formed. Trading channels with many touches on both ends that are close to parallel are stubborn (hard to reverse). At first glance, the price action seems random because the bars are mixed and overlapping. A closer look reveals that there is a gradual trend. Recognizing this pattern early can set up nice trades. The key is to follow the trend. For instance, in a downward sloping channel your plan is to short on rallies that stall at the upper end of the trading channel and to take gains at the lower end of the trading channel. If the trading channel has a fairly steep trend of greater than 30 degrees, it is best not to “get cute” buying bounces off of the low end of the channel. Remember, the trend is your friend and the trend is down in this case. A selling climax could be pending and you do not need that risk exposure. In the chart below, the price action looks random. When we add the trendlines, we have clarity and it is easier to structure trades when the channel is revealed.</p>

<p>Downward sloping channels tend to end with a breakdown below the lower end of the trading channel. That selling climax attracts buyers and the market reverses back into the channel. Often the market can run back to the upper end of the channel. The selling climax and the bounce confirm support and often the downward sloping channel turns into a horizontal trading range. This same behavior applies to upward sloping trading channels. If the trading channel has a positive slope, it is likely to breach the upper trendline on a buying climax. Those climaxes reverse in 4-5 bars and the market retraces back into the channel. It could fall as far as the lower end of the channel and then transition into a horizontal trading range. The ideal trading channel will have many touches on both extremes, a slope that is less than 45 degrees and the trendlines will be close to parallel. I will provide examples in future articles.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Wedges">Wedges</h2>
<p>Wedges are formed when two trendlines are converging. Longer term trendlines carry more weight in a wedge formation and they indicate which breakout is most likely. There is no need to guess, wait for technical confirmation. A bullish flag formation is an example where the longer term trendline is upward sloping and the shorter term trendline is downward sloping. Wedges where both trendlines are equal in length and in slope can breakout either way so you need to be patient. It is important to wait for the breakout and follow through. In the chart below you can see how one of the wedge breakouts was a fake. Make sure you have follow through. There are often shorter term wedges that are nested within longer term wedges. Nice tight wedges where the slope of both trendlines are less than 30 degrees produce excellent breakouts. With all trendlines, more touches are better. Just before the trendlines converge the SPY is in a horizontal price compression. The spring is coiled and ready to release. Below are two examples. The short term wedge has very steep trendlines. Both can easily be breached and you can see the <strong>High-Fake</strong>. In this case it is very important to wait for follow through because it could easily go the other way. In the second example the trendlines are longer term and they have a more gradual slope. This breakdown would be more reliable, but we still need follow through. In this case, the follow through was not very good and we can see green candles and overlap. </p>

<p>The price action into a trendline will often indicate if it is just being tested or if a breach is likely. Remember, the trend is your friend and we want to buy bounces off of a longer term <strong>Low+</strong> trendline. If the price action jumps off of an upward sloping trendline and there are candles with long tails above the trendline, it is likely to hold. Stubborn price action with little momentum into the trendline and with multiple tests also suggests that it will hold. On the other hand, stacked red candles with little to no overlap that attack the trendline on heavy volume are a sign that a trendline breach is likely. If that breach happens on the first attempt with a convincing close below it, you are likely to get follow through selling and the odds of a trend reversal is high. Mixed overlapping candles on light volume are a sign of weak trend strength and it could be vulnerable.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many types of trendlines and they are a very important part of our technical analysis. Upward sloping trendlines that connect the lows (<strong>Low+</strong>) and downward sloping trendlines that connect the highs (<strong>High-</strong>) are more reliable than their counterparts. Professional traders and institutions use them and that makes them relevant. The trend is your friend and you should always look to join that tailwind. We don’t trade trend reversals until we have a technical breakdown on heavy volume with follow through and we want that trendline attacked with long candles and no retracement. </p>
