<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In this article we are going to continue our analysis of price action for the market on a longer term basis. Please make sure to read the first 2 articles. </h4>
<p>We know from our analysis in the previous article that we are officially in a bear market (down 20%+) and we might be on the brink of a shorting opportunity. We are only going to conduct price action analysis, but in future articles we will put all of the pieces together and use all forms of technical analysis. The hollow candles in the chart are important since they have long bodies, short tails/wicks and relatively heavy volume. I will post the same chart many times so that the points are easier to reference. </p>

<p>23. In the previous chart we suspected that a light volume bounce might be running out of steam. We are in a bear market so we need to favor the short side. The gap down in the third candle on the chart was the clue and now we want to see that gap hold for a few days. That would be a sign that buyers do not have the power to fill it. Our suspicions were confirmed by the long red candle. It’s time to take swing shorts here and we want to see half of that long red candle preserved. </p>
<p>24. The mid-point of the long red candle held and we saw continued selling. In the first candle with the blue arrow everything looks great. We had that first long red candle (23.) and then a doji below the low of that candle and then this long red candle. Everything is going great for a short position. However, notice how the next day the market gapped higher (solid red candle). Sellers regained control and the candle closed on its low, but there were some signs of buying. Also notice now the third candle with the arrow was red, but it had a massive gap up and then it spend the day drifting lower. It closed near its low, but buyers are interested. How do we know? If there were no interest on the part of buyers we would not have gapped higher. Orders to sell would have been layered above the close the previous day and there would not have been a gap up. Swing traders should take some gains here. A bounce looks likely. </p>
<p>25. The market staged a nice little rally and there were a few nice long green candles. The mid point of the long red candle (23) was preserved, but we did rally above the open from the long red candle (24). This long red candle (25) is very damaging for bulls. It erases the previous 3 long green candles and it closes on its low. We need confirmation before we can re-enter shorts. The next candle is a doji at the low from the prior red candle and that is fine. The next candle after that is red and it takes out the low from (24). This is a good entry point for shorts. This is also happening on heavy volume so it legitimizes the move. </p>

<p>26. This long red candle closes on its low of the day on heavy volume. We want the mid-point preserved and it confirms our short position. </p>
<p>27. The market is working its way lower, but we are starting to see overlap and green candles. That is a sign that support is forming. We can expect a bounce and this would be a good area to take partial gains. We want the mid-point from the red candle (26) preserved. </p>
<p>28. The market gapped down to a new low of the year. The open of that candle was also the low for that candle and a massive gap reversal was underway and buyers were aggressive. By the close, this turned into a giant bullish engulfing candle off of the low of the year. This is a sign of support. The next day a long red candle appeared, but the half-way point of the green engulfing candle was preserved. The price action for the next few days stayed well above the mid-point of the long green candle and that is a sign of support. </p>
<p>29. The long green candle before the blue shaded area came on heavy volume and it closed above the open from a previous red candle (28). We are seeing long mixed green and red candles and that is a sign of volatility. The price action all year has been bearish. It is too early to consider longs, but we should expect volatility. </p>
<p>30. This long green candle came on heavy volume. It closed above the compression and the open from 3 prior long red candles. We are also seeing follow through buying. This is a time to wait on the sidelines. If the bounce stalls and we see tiny bodied candles and light volume, we can expect another wave of selling. If the rally continues on high volume, it might have room to run. </p>

<p>Reading price action takes some time to learn, but how we get from point A to point B matters. How the current price action fits into the longer term context also matters. These candles help us to gauge momentum. We can tell when it is building or waning. If you learn how to read price action and you combine that skill with basic technical analysis (trendlines, horizontal support/resistance and major moving averages) you don’t need any indicators.</p>
<p>This was a very difficult year for longer term swing trading. Extreme volatility was evident and we saw long mixed candles, big drops and violent bounces. Using price action alone we were able to identify the directional bias and we were able to find many “sweet spots” that yielded big gains. You had to take the gains and then wait for the next window. </p>
