<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The longer term price action set the tone for this trading day.</h4>
<p>By now you know my mantra… market first, market first, market first. That is the starting point for every trade and that is why this lesson is at the beginning of the course. This can be used for stocks as well, but it is critical that you get your market bearings each day before you trade stock.</p>
<p>Context is critically important when you are reading price action. What do the longer term daily charts look like? Is the market in a strong trend? Is the market trapped in a trading range longer term? Did we get to the current price with a Lamborghini or a bicycle? Are the candles mixed (weak trend) or are they of a single color (strong trend)? Is there overlap with other candles (weak trend) or are they stacked (strong trend)? All of these questions need to be answered so let’s start with a longer term chart of the SPY and then let’s drill down to an M15 chart and finally an M5 chart. You can see my comments in the charts below. By the way, all of these comments were posted live in the chat room during the last week so I am not playing “Monday morning Quarterback”. Reading price action is a skill that can be learned and it works. Below the charts you can read the scenarios I am expecting today with the probability of each. At the very bottom I conclude this section with a chart of what happened and a live video that I recorded on the opening bell where I described the price action bar-by-bar.</p>

<p>Today the SPY is going to challenge a resistance level at $380 and it will open above it. Stacked green candles with little to no overlap in the first 30 minutes would be a sign of heavy buying. That scenario is unlikely because we know that sellers are present based on the recent price action. If we get that pattern the SPY will start to fill in the D1 gap and we could have a few more days of follow through. There is no reason to chase anything in this market so I will be passive if this scenario plays out (20%). A gradual drift higher on the open with mixed overlapping candles would be a sign of weak trend strength. When that move stalls, a good shorting opportunity would set up. Look for a bearish hammer/bearish engulf off of the high of the day as a sign that a reversal is pending. This scenario has a 20% chance of playing out. A more likely scenario is a bid check. The market tries to fill in some of the overnight gap up. Mixed overlapping candles will be a sign that the trend strength during the dip is weak. That will give us time to find stocks with relative strength and we can separate the fakes from the real deal. Once the market finds support we can expect a rally and it will be time to buy these stocks. We do not want the retracement to be deep (more than half of the gap up preserved) or to last more than an hour. If that happens it would suggest decent selling pressure. This scenario has a good chance of playing out and it presents the best opportunities for us (30%). A strong gap reversal would have long red candles and brief pauses. Half of the overnight gains would easily be stripped away. This would suggest that sellers are fairly aggressive. The gap fill would be fairly deep and the pullback will take a couple of hours to run its course. In this scenario you would focus on shorts. We want the bounces to last less than 30 minutes. This scenario has a 20% chance of playing out. The final scenario is a complete gap reversal. Stacked long red candles consecutively in the first 30 minutes with little to no overlap would be a sign of heavy selling. We have seen decent buying and the big down gap reversal two days ago tells us that buyers are aggressive enough to prevent that. This scenario only has a 10% chance of playing out.</p>
<p>It is critically important to get the longer term context and then to drill down to the shorter time frames. Understand the possible scenarios and know the characteristics of each one. When they start to unfold, you will know what to expect and what action you plan to take. You should also know which scenario is most desirable and which one is most likely (they are not always the same). The chart below is how the day actually played out. </p>

<p>The scenario we got was not the one we wanted. Gap and go patterns force us to chase early in the day and that is never wise. We do not have time to properly vet (observe) stocks and it is difficult to separate the real from the fake. This pattern also has a tendency to run to its destination and compress. That makes it difficult to trade the rest of the day. That means we have to trade smaller size early (because we don’t ever want to chase) so that we can make some money early in the day. It also means that we should take gains after 90 minutes of trading because the rest of the day the market will compress. Being able to read price action told us which scenario was going to play out and what actions we should take. The SPY stayed in that tight compression the rest of the day and there was a breakout in the last 10 minutes of trading. In the recording, you can clearly hear these predictions after 15 minutes of trading. I’m not clairvoyant, I just know how to read price action. </p>
