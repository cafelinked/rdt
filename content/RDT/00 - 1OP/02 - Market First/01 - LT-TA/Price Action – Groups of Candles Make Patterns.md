<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Small groups of candles tell us a lot about trend strength and momentum. We will focus on them and then we will see them in common technical patters.</h4>
<p>In the previous article, we discussed the information that we can gather from individual candles. Now let’s consider what a group of a candles together might tell us. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Mixed Tiny Bodied Candles</h4>
<p>Consecutive tiny bodied mixed candles are a sign of weak trend strength. Even if the market has a gradual directional bias, these candles indicate that neither side has conviction. After a strong trend, this pattern will be a sign that the momentum is waning and it might be prudent to take partial gains on positions. In the example below, the market had been trending lower. The green candles are erasing (overlapping) the red candles and that tells us sellers are losing control. </p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tiny Candles of One Color</h4>
<p>If the candles are tiny and of a single color, the trend can continue, but traders need to tread cautiously. In the example below, we are seeing green candles and some dojis. This grind higher is on borrowed time. If sellers were not engaged, the candles will be tall and there would not be any resistance. Since they are small, we know that sellers are close at hand. The other “tell” is volume. Buyers have a very low level of conviction in this instance. If they were aggressively buying we would see heavy volume. If you see long green candles at the end of this pattern that are instantly reversed by red candles, the move is exhausted and a reversal is possible. Typically, a move of this nature will transition into a sideways range where we see mixed candles. The candles are small so we know that neither side is overly aggressive and that is why this pattern usually ends in a horizontal trading range.</p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tails Under Body</h4>
<p>When we see long tails under body after a big drop, it is a sign of support. Conversely, long wicks above the body after a big rally would signal resistance. The chart below happened at the end of a big market drop. Sellers continued to pound bids, but buyers were interested. They scooped up shares at that price and it was a sign that support was forming. After a big market drop, you need to be very cautious buying dips just because you see tails under body. The magnitude of the drop is a sign of heavy selling and you need to respect it. Make sure a base forms. Often it is best to wait for a bounce and a retest of that support before buying. We want that higher low double bottom after heavy selling. If the drop was relatively small (dip), the tails under body could provide a good entry point, especially if the longer-term trend is up. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stacked Candles</h4>
<p>Stacked consecutive candles of a single color with little to no overlap on heavy volume are incredibly powerful. This is a sign that the trend strength is extreme and you should expect follow through in that direction. In the chart below you can see how the candles do retrace. The wick of the second candle goes into the body of the first candle. In general, we want the half-way point preserved. That shows that sellers have layered offers higher up and they are eager to short any bounce. When they can’t get filled at the higher price they lower their offers. Consequently, the previous candle is not completely retraced. This is a sign of strong selling pressure. In the chart below you can see how all of those half-way points are preserved. If one of the candles gapped up on the open above the close of the prior candle we would have overlap. That is acceptable, but not ideal because it does show that there is some buying pressure. Imagine that there are no wicks or tails in the chart below. That is the ideal pattern. Sellers are so aggressive that the candles never retrace. They are hitting every bid in sight and they are clearly in control. In general, when we have a long red candle, we want all of it preserved with very little retracement. The same rules would apply to stacked green candles and they are equally powerful.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>Longer-term groups of candles form patterns. My intent is not to write a book on these patterns. If I see them, they are of interest to me and can spot them on a chart, but I don’t go looking for them. These are some of the more common ones you will see. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Double Tops &amp; Bottoms</h4>
<p>Double Tops and Double Bottoms are significant technical patterns because they are a sign of trend exhaustion. In the chart below you can see that the SPY peaks and it drops. Dips are a normal part of any up trend and the market tries to recover and to resume the rally. In this instance it can’t get back to the peak and it makes a lower high double top. This is more significant to me than a double top where the SPY was able to get back to the previous high. The fact that it did not hit resistance earlier tells me that sellers are not as aggressive. A lower high is formed because sellers are so anxious that they don’t believe the market will get back to the old high so they start selling before it gets there. You can see how the selling pressure builds and this is the start of a bear market. In the far right side you can see a higher low double bottom. From the low, the market is able to bounce. That is normal in a down trend. However, when sellers try to drive the market down, buyers surface. Again, I prefer a higher low double bottom to a double bottom because it tells me that buyers are super aggressive. They do not believe they will have a chance to buy at the low so they start bidding before it even gets there. When a double low forms, buyers are not as aggressive and sellers are able to push the market back down to that old low. In the chart you will also notice a Head &amp; Shoulders and an Inverted Head &amp; Shoulders pattern. Those don’t interest me much because it is the lower high double top and the higher low double bottom portion of that pattern I am focusing on. </p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cup &amp; Handle</h4>
<p>Cup &amp; Handle formations are another form of a double bottom higher low. The inverse pattern would also be of interest and it would be a bearish pattern. Technicians get all excited when these patterns conform perfectly. The base of the handle needs to represent a 50% retracement. From my perspective, it does not matter. This is a higher low double bottom, or a lower high double top if it is upside down. Don’t get too carried away with these names, just know that these are signs of a new trend and that a breakout through horizontal resistance (horizontal support if it is upside down) is likely. That breakout above the lip and handle is bullish and that will start the next leg higher. </p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bullish Flag</h4>
<p>Bullish flag formations are powerful. They involve trendline analysis, so please make sure to <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/long-term-technical/trendlines/">read that article</a>. The long-term trend is up and “the trend is our friend.” Dips are common during an uptrend. We are looking for short-term down trends in the context of a longer-term up trend. During the dip, we do not assume that this is a bull flag, we wait for technical confirmation. For all we know, this might be more than a dip and the trend could be reversing. When these shorter-term down trendlines are breached, we have an excellent entry point to join the longer-term up trend. The key is to have a really steady flag pole (upward sloping longer-term trend). If the flag pole is wimpy (mixed overlapping candles on light volume), we have to be suspicious of the bullish flag. If the flag pole features stacked green candles on heavy volume with multiple technical breakouts along the way, the dip is more likely to be just that… a dip. That means that the High- breach will be a good buying opportunity. Can you spot any other good bull flags in the chart below? At very least, we would expect the breakout to challenge the recent high. If we quickly blow through that prior high, we should expect that the next leg of the move higher is going to begin. If the move to the previous high has mixed tiny candles, a gradual drift higher and light volume, it is struggling to make a new high. That is a sign of resistance and we need to take profits near that high. Knowing that a retest of the high is likely for a bull flag, allows us to quantify how far the stock is likely to move (at minimum) and we can use that information to structure our options trade. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bearish Flag</h4>
<p>In the chart below, we have a Bear Flag. Consistent with what I just described for a bull flag, we need a sturdy flag pole. In this case, the SPY had dropped 20% in a few months with long red Key Bars. The market does not go straight down or straight up. We have the makings for a decent set up. Notice how the market drops to the low and then we start seeing tails? This is a sign of support and if you are short, you should be taking gains on shorts. There are 3 stacked green candles off of the low and this looks great – right? If those were the only bars we could see, yes. After a 20% market drop (rare) we should expect some short covering (profit taking). This is not nearly enough evidence for me and I am not going to stand in front of this freight train. That is as far as the bounce gets and the SPY starts to compress in a tight range with mixed candles. This is a sign of resistance. That red Key Bar that breaches the Low+ trendline is exactly the way we want to attack trendlines. Strong flag pole, wimpy bounce and an attack on the contra trendline. Those are the keys to a good bear flag. If we have a weak flag pole (wimpy down trend), and an organized bounce off of the low that takes a long time to reverse, we have a weak set up and any attempt to retest the low is likely to turn into a higher low double bottom.</p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Wedge</h4>
<p>A wedge forms when High- and Low+ trendlines converge. When the slope and the duration of both trendlines is equal, the wedge is balanced. As with all trendlines, if the wedge trendlines are very steep, the breakouts are less meaningful. These can easily be breached both ways and the market is extremely volatile. That volatility will subside and eventually a more meaningful wedge will form. It will be a longer-term wedge and it is likely to compress around the mid-point. This is a compression. Buyers and sellers are active and one side will eventually prevail. We don’t guess the direction of the breakout, we wait. If one of the trendlines is “older”, it tends to prevail, but not always. Remember that if the older line is breached, it is also more significant because it is older. Here’s a word of caution, often the first move on a balanced wedge is a fake. FOMO traders will load up in that direction. It fails quickly and those traders will be flushed out, creating pressure in the opposite direction. Then, the other side of the wedge is breached and that is the real move. This is why it is critically important to wait for follow through on breaches. “Be the second mouse.”</p>

                    </div>
                
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ascending Wedge</h4>
<p>An ascending wedge has two ascending trendlines, a High+ (upper) and a Low+ (lower). The High+ is more gradual in slope and the Low+ is steeper. This wedge is a price compression and it is a sign that a breach is coming. Some ascending wedges result in a pullback and some produce a breakout. The stock is in a strong up trend and that is reflected in the steeper Low+. This is longer-term bullish and any dip is likely to lead to a bull flag. There are times when the stock will blow through the High+. This is a sign of incredible strength. We want that to happen on long green candles and heavy volume. Zoom out to get the context of where this pattern is appearing. Is it at the lower end of the long-term range or the upper end of a long-term range. What is the overall strength of the stock on a long-term basis? Has the move higher come in “fits and spurts” (pops and drops) or is it tight and organized with consecutive greens. These patterns will help you to determine which move is more likely. Don’t guess, wait for the breakout or the breakdown. In general, we know that High- and Low+ breaches are more reliable than High+ and Low- breaches. For that reason, I expect these to produce short-term contra trend moves and I will not chase High+ or Low- breaches unless I have those high volume long stacked candles.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Descending Wedge</h4>
<p>The descending wedge has a steep High- (upper) compared to the Low- (lower). The trend is down and that is bearish. All of the characteristics mentioned for the ascending wedge apply here as well, so let’s focus on the trend and find some clues. We know that weaker trends have a lot of retracement. Notice that the bounces have nice height and good duration. Towards the end of the wedge, the market is making lower lows, but they are marginal new lows (barely through the previous low). This is a sign of support. Also notice how the volume is drying up. That is a sign that sellers are not as aggressive and we can see a higher low double bottom. This tells us that a High- breakout is more likely than a Low- breakdown. From the <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/long-term-technical/trendlines/">trendline article</a>, we also know that Low- breakdowns are not as reliable as a Low+ breakdown. For a Low-, we need to see those stacked “reds” on heavy volume and we do NOT have that here. </p>

<p>We started off this article describing groups of candles. These are the building blocks you need to learn.
