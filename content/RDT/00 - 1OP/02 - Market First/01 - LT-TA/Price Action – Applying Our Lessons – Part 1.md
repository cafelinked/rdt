<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Let’s conduct longer-term technical analysis for the market using price action. We will go through an entire year and this is the first of four parts.</h4>
<p>The principles for reading price action can be used for any time frame. If you are a day trader, you would use five-minute charts. If you are an investor, you would use weekly charts. My longer-term swing trades last from 3-4 weeks so I will use daily charts to read the price action in this section. Later in the course we will use shorter time frames for overnight swing trades and for day trades. </p>
<p>Before we get started I want to mention a few things. The same chart will be posted throughout this article. The longer term chart allows us to see how the current price action fits into the longer term picture (we call this context). I posted the same chart many times so that you do not have to keep scrolling back in the article to see the data point I am referencing. In the chart you will see hollow candles. These are key bars and they have long bodied candles, short tails/wicks and above average volume. As you know from the previous articles, these candles are very important to us. Finally, we are not using any other forms technical analysis (trendlines or moving averages). This section is purely reading price action. We will add those other forms of technical analysis when we apply everything we’ve learned. </p>

<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The long red candle should be bearish, but notice how we had a long red candle the day before that. When this second long red candle formed, the market gapped higher and all of the losses from the prior day were erased on the open. Eventually, the second red candle did close below the prior red candle. While this price action appears bearish (two long red candles in a row), the overlap tells us that this is not a strong move. Why? If sellers were truly aggressive, the second red candle would never have gapped up the following day. They would have kept the pressure on. This buying pressure is confirmed the next day when the green bar (hollow) closes above the midpoint of the second red candle. We want those midpoints on these key bars preserved. These are long bodied, mixed candles and they suggest volatility. </li><li>The market rallied off of the recent low and the long green candle is encouraging. It closed just below horizontal resistance on the daily chart. Unfortunately, it was erased the next day by a long red candle and the midpoint of the green candle was breached (bearish). The interpretation of these two candles and the context from the start of the chart is that conditions are very volatile and there is not a clear sense of market direction. I would not be taking longer term swing trades in this environment because the market could go either way and a big move could be pending.</li><li>The market is compressing at horizontal resistance and it made a marginal new high (barely got through the old high). The price action before the compression included a bullish hammer and stacked green candles with little to no overlap. This would normally be bullish, but notice how the rally took place on very light volume. The market was not able to advance after making the new high and the tiny bodied candles suggested that sellers were nearby. Why? If buyers were truly aggressive, they would have been able to add to the breakout after those stacked green candles and the volume would have been heavy. </li><li>This long red candle is confirmation that we needed to remain cautious. To that point, we have mixed long candles and extreme volatility. The light volume rally to the new high could not be trusted and now it looks like sellers are going to take a turn. The long red candle breached the halfway point of the prior long green candle, it broke horizontal support at the bottom of the compression (shaded blue) and the red candle closed on its low. From a longer term swing viewpoint, it is still too early to take short positions. The recent volatility tells us that the long red candle could quickly be erased. It did come on heavy volume and that gives it more legitimacy. We want to see that midpoint preserved for a few days. If the SPY can’t rally above that midpoint, we might have a shorting opportunity. </li></ol>

<p>5. The midpoint of the long red candle held for a few days and we could have taken bearish swing positions when we had confirmation that sellers were in control. There was some overlap in the candles on the way down, but the volume was very heavy and there were not any green candles. The long bullish hammer was the first sign of support. The low from the bullish hammer held and subsequent candles had tails. Sellers remained aggressive, but the fact that the candles could not close on the low of the day indicated that buyers were interested and that support was forming (tails under body). We can also see mixed, overlapping candles and that tells us that the momentum is starting to wane. From a longer term swing trading standpoint, this is a time to take gains on short positions. Given the magnitude of the drop, the heavy volume and the lower highs, it would be too early to take long swing positions. This is a time to evaluate.</p>
<p>6. The market is trying to bounce after a big drop, but the level of conviction is low. We know that from the light volume. The relative high at this price level retreated instantly/significantly and buyers attempted a breakout a second time. The third attempt failed quickly. The bearish hammer was formed by a gap down. During the day the market tried to rally above the resistance level and we know that from the long wick. Sellers did not squander this opportunity and they pounded the market down, forming the bearish hammer. The next day a long red candle was formed and we saw follow through selling. </p>
<p>7. Conditions remain volatile and the price action from the start of the chart has been all over the board. We can see that a negative bias is starting to form. The market is making lower highs. As long as the midpoint of the long red candle is preserved for a few days, we can take short swing positions. </p>
<p>8. The bottom fell out of the market and it gapped down to a new low for the year. The opening price that day was also the low that day and this giant candle closed on its high. That was a sign of major support. Buyers gobbled up stocks and that candle closed above the midpoint of the previous red candle. This is a very significant intraday reversal because it took place on heavy volume. Swing traders needed to take gains on shorts and a bounce is likely. It is too early to buy from a swing trading standpoint. This is a horizontal support level, but the bias has been to the downside. As I mentioned in the previous article, we need additional confirmation that support is in after big drops. It would be foolish to think that the market is going to rally and never look back after the selling we have witnessed the last few months. </p>

<p>9. The market has breached the midpoint of the long green candle from the low of the year and sellers continue to probe for support. Notice in the chart that the volume during this probe has been light (blue line &lt; 0). That tells us that sellers are not as aggressive. Also notice that we are finding support above the low of the year. This is a sign that buyers are defending that support and that they do not believe they will have a chance to buy at that level. A higher low double bottom is starting to form. </p>
<p>10. The market is bouncing and it has been able to rally above the open from the prior long red candle. The first green candle is a bullish hammer and the market closed on its high that day. </p>
<p>11. While these 3 candles are encouraging, it is still too early to trade from the long side. Notice how the green candles have overlap. Each day the market gapped lower, support was confirmed and then the market closed above the prior day’s high. Overlap like this is a sign that the trend is weak. That is confirmed by the light volume. Swing traders can try long positions here, but they need to maintain tight stops and exit at the first sign of trouble. If the market can continue to grind higher on heavy volume, it will confirm the strength and only then can we get more aggressive with longs. At this point we have to respect the negative bias from the start of the chart.</p>
<p>12. The rally continues on light volume and the candles have overlap (weak trend). The red candle off of the relative high is a warning sign. If the midpoint is preserved for a few days, it would be a sign that buyers do not have the power to challenge the high. This entire move for the last few weeks could be nothing more than a bounce that has run its course. Swing traders with long exposure should start exiting trades. A week has passed since the long red candle and the market is making lower highs. Swing traders should be contemplating short positions.</p>

<p>In the next article we will continue our price action analysis. As we look back on the entire chart, we can see that the last bar on the chart is lower than the first bar on the chart. There is a negative bias, but the price action is extremely choppy. The market is taking four steps down and then three steps back. The volume spikes are happening on the drops and that also confirms selling pressure. This is a very difficult swing trading environment and we have to pick our points carefully.</p>
