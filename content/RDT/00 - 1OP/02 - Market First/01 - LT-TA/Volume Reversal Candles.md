<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Heavy volume moves tell us that the move is legitimate and light volume tells us it can’t be trusted.</h4>
<p>Almost every technical indicator has two components: price and volume. That alone should tell you how important volume is to our technical analysis. Volume is very easy to analyze and it is either heavy, average or light. It does not require lengthy explanations so it does not get the attention it deserves. Consequently, it is overlooked by novice traders. Let’s not make the mistake of glossing over this topic. </p>
<p><strong>VOLUME CONVEYS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND IT NEEDS TO BE A MAJOR PART OF YOUR TECHNICAL ANALYSIS!</strong></p>
<p>I hope that got your attention. Volume tells us how excited buyers and sellers are. That in turn helps us gauge the strength of a trend. Our goal as traders is to predict price movement and sustained heavy volume helps us to determine direction. </p>
<p>If a manufacturer reduced the price of their product there would be no way to measure the success/failure of the promotion without volume. They wouldn’t know if the product is moving or sitting on the shelves. Volume helps them determine the demand for it at that price and how much of it they need to produce. If the product is flying off of the shelves and the line is out the door and around the corner, they can safely predict that this promotion will be successful. We can’t assess the quality of a market move without looking at volume. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">What if there is light volume and no move?</h6>
<p>This is common when the market is compressing in a tight range. It is a sign of equilibrium and neither side has an advantage. At some point a news item will spark a breakout one way or the other. Set alerts above and below the compression and wait. Since there is light volume, the trading range could last a long time. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">What if there is heavy volume and no move?</h6>
<p>This is a good scenario. The heavy volume indicates that buyers and sellers are interested. Shortly, one side or the other will prevail and that breakout is likely to have follow through (“legs”). On the breakout, the losing side will scramble to adjust and the winning side will add to positions. The breakout on volume will hit everyone’s radar and the frenzy is on! Custom Search in Option Stalker Pro will find stocks with heavy volume that are in a compression. Set your alerts above and below the compression and wait for the breakout. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Why do light volume rallies happen?</h6>
<p>We often see light volume rallies at the end of a long term uptrend. Because the trend is strong, sellers are extremely passive and they are holding out for a higher price. Even a small buyer can drive the price higher. Imagine this attitude on the part of the seller, “If you want it, come and get it at this nice high price. If you are not interested at that level, I will just hang on to it.” This is what we call a sellers boycott. They are simply not interested in selling unless they get what they consider to be a premium. At that high price, buyers are not willing to load up so the volume remains light. A light volume spike to a new high could be a buying climax so pay attention to those because a drop is likely very soon. Of course, a light volume trend lower in a bear market would indicate that buyers are not interested. They are expecting lower prices and they will wait for signs of support. This is a “buyer boycott” and it can be characterized by this attitude, “If you are that anxious to sell, come and get me all the way down here.”</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Why do light volume bounces happen?</h6>
<p>When we refer to a “bounce”, it suggests that the rebound is temporary and that the longer term down trend will prevail. Most traders don’t understand bounces. “Why is anyone buying this crap when the market is clearly going down?” The market does not go straight up or straight down. At some point during a big decline, short sellers will start taking profits. That buying provides support and other short sellers will also start to take gains. This will cause a bounce. Institutions are always “testing the water” and they can spark short term bounces as well. They will try to spark short covering to shake traders out of positions. Remember, short sellers are looking for signs of support because they are eager to take gains. The institutions are more interested in the magnitude and the duration of the bounce. They are constantly trying to gauge how aggressive buyers and sellers are and they watch volume very closely. A brief and shallow light volume bounce that only lasts six bars will tell them that the selling pressure is heavy. The institutions will exit what they bought and short even more. They don’t care if they lost money trying to spark a bounce because that will provide them with important information. Chances are, if the longer term trend is down, they have huge short positions. If the bounce has good height and big volume, there is a likelihood that it could last a long time. In that event, they will start reducing longer term short positions. The same principles I’ve described would apply to light volume dips in the context of a longer term up trend. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Does a light volume rally mean sell short?</h6>
<p>Absolutely not! Light volume in and of itself does not constitute a trading opportunity. These moves can continue for long periods of time and they can inflict incredible pain if you are early. Sometimes, the volume will increase during the move and it will transition into a legitimate trend. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">How should we swing trade heavy volume declines?</h6>
<p>If the market is in a long term down trend it will be confirmed by heavy volume. Your objective is to short bounces when they stall and break technical support. Take gains during big drops and go to cash. Repeat. During bounces you can evaluate the magnitude of the bounce and the volume. If the height of the bounce recaptures much of the recent decline (rally above the open from a previous long red candle) and if it comes on heavy volume, it is likely to last a while. If the move starts to gain traction, you can join it with small size (relative to your recent short positions) and know that this is going to be a short term trade. Be ready to take gains at the first sign of trouble and be ready to go short on a technical breakdown. For most swing traders who can’t watch the market during the day, I would discourage this tactic. You are “getting cute” and trading against the longer term down trend. When the bounce reverses you will be scrambling to exit longs instead of focusing on entering short positions. If the bounce is shallow and the volume is light, it is not likely to last long. That would be a sign that sellers are still nearby and you might need to re-establish your short position quickly. Watch for these tiny bounces when the momentum is very strong (stacked red candles) and try to stick with the short position. That price action tells us that sellers are very aggressive. Use these same concepts (in reverse) during heavy volume long term up trends. In a strong up trend, swing traders want to “buy dips and sell rips”.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">How long can light volume moves last?</h6>
<p>The Fed printed money like mad after the 2008-2009 financial crisis and credit risk was low for a decade. Bond yields were near 0% and investors had to stay in equities to generate a return. Corporations were issuing cheap debt and using the proceeds to buy back shares. These forces kept a very strong bid to the market and the dips were brief and shallow. The end result was a very light volume rally that lasted for nearly a decade. Don’t discount the longevity of light volume moves. Draw your trendlines and wait for those technical breaches. </p>
<p>So let’s take a look at the volume during the last year and how it helped us to determine which side to be on. The context of the chart below is that the market was in a VERY strong two-year up trend and that it was starting to transition to a bear market. To this point, the dips were brief and shallow. Notice how the drops came on heavy volume and the rallies came on light volume. Initially, the bounces had nice height. Long term bull markets die hard because buyers are still trained to buy dips. 1OVol is our proprietary indicator. If it is above zero, the volume is greater than the 20-period average. If it is below zero, it is below average. When the market bounced in the chart below, the heavy volume only lasted a day or two. When the market dropped, the volume was heavy for many days in a row. This tells us that sellers are in control and to favor the short side. The blue boxes highlighted bounces. Notice how light the volume was. Once the D1 up trendlines were breached, the bottom fell out quickly and the volume spiked. </p>

<p>At this stage, traders are starting to respect the trend reversal from bullish to bearish. They can see that the heavy volume from the first half of the year is happening on the drops. They also noticed that the market was making lower highs and lower lows. The rally at the beginning of the chart took place on light volume. There were only a few days where it spiked. The bounce lasted for a month and it had good height. Traders that tried to stick with short positions took extreme “heat”. Some did not expect the bounce to last so long or to bounce so high so they exited short positions. That probably extended the life of the bounce. When that up trendline was breached, the selling pressure was fast and furious and the S&amp;P 500 lost almost 1000 points (large shaded blue area). In the last two months the market has staged another light volume rally. Notice how there are only a few heavy volume days within this move. There are also mixed overlapping candles and that is a sign of weak trend strength. Swing traders should be in cash waiting for the up trendline to be breached. Seasonal strength could fuel the move into year-end. Don’t be early with short positions, but know that a nasty drop is looming. </p>

<p>Volume is so easy to analyze that there are not many articles written about it. It is either heavy, average or light. Don’t discount the importance of volume just because it does not get the same attention as price action. Start your analysis with volume and make it a priority. That’s how important it is. Volume tells you how aggressive buyers and sellers are at a particular price level and it will help you to gauge direction. With regards to position sizing, you want to ramp up when you are trading in the direction of a long term trend with heavy volume. During light volume contra trend moves you want to be in cash or in very small positions.</p>
