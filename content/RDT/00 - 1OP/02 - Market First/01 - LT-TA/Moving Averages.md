<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Major moving averages are important on daily charts because traders use them.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Daily_Moving_Averages_MA_">Daily Moving Averages (MA)</h2>
<p>Longer term moving averages are significant because traders use them. The 20-day, 50-day, 100-day and the 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) are used for daily charts. For purposes of these articles, I will refer to the simple moving average as MA and the exponential moving average as EMA.</p>
<p>These major moving averages are used by most traders and institutions. That reliance makes them relevant and you will often see the S&amp;P 500 migrate towards these levels.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Detecting_Moving_Average_Breach_During_Market_Decline">Detecting Moving Average Breach During Market Decline</h2>
<p>When the market is declining from a high, these major moving averages will act as support. If I am looking for a continued market drop, I do not want the SPY to gradually drift down to it or to sit on that major moving average. This would be a sign of support and if I see this type of price action I should be watching for a bounce. A strong market decline will attack that MA with a long red candle and it will breach it on the first effort. A close below it would be bearish, especially if the close is materially below it and if there is follow through selling the next day. A series of consecutive closes below that MA serve as technical confirmation that the market is weak. During the decline, if horizontal support and longer term up trendlines are breached, they will also serve as technical confirmation that the decline is strong.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Detecting_Moving_Average_Support">Detecting Moving Average Support</h2>
<p>If the move down to a major moving average is tenuous and the candles are mixed and overlapping, the trend is weak and the moving average is likely to hold. The ideal pattern for bulls is a brief intraday attempt to test the MA that does not quite reach it before the market bounces. This is a sign that buyers are aggressive and that they don’t want to miss this buying opportunity.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Detecting_Moving_Average_Resistance">Detecting Moving Average Resistance</h2>
<p>In this scenario, the market has dropped below the major moving average. If the climb back to it is tenuous with mixed overlapping green and red candles, it is not likely to get through, particularly if the market has spent more than a week below it. If the market backs off of that MA before it even tests it, you will know that sellers are aggressive. They do not want to miss the opportunity to sell stocks at that level so they do not even wait for it to be touched.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Detecting_Moving_Average_Breach_During_Market_Rally">Detecting Moving Average Breach During Market Rally</h2>
<p>If the market has been in a prolonged decline, it will eventually find support. During the rebound the market will attack the MA with a series of long green candles. You do not want a gradual move higher, you want an explosive move. If a downward sloping trend line or a horizontal resistance level is breached as well, you can expect a breakout above the MA. When you see this pattern, the SPY needs to close well above the MA and you want to see follow though buying the next few days.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Trading_Moving_Average_Breakouts_Breakdowns">Trading Moving Average Breakouts &amp; Breakdowns</h2>
<p>If the market drifts down to a major MA and it chops back and forth, it is likely to spend time there and the day-to-day movement above and below the MA becomes irrelevant over time. In this case you could see the Bollinger Bands compress and the market will fall into a trading range. In this scenario you need to draw horizontal support and resistance lines at the recent high and low. Until the market breaks out of that compression you have to assume it will continue. Once those support/resistance levels are breached, the SPY will be far enough away from them to have the “escape velocity” it needs and you can expect follow through in that direction.</p>
<p>When the 50-day MA is greater than the 100-day MA and the 100-day MA is greater than the 200-day MA, the market is in a strong long-term uptrend. The opposite would be a sign of a strong market downtrend.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Golden_Cross">Golden Cross</h2>
<p>When the 50-day MA is below the 200-day MA and it crosses back above the 200-day MA, it is referred to as a Golden Cross and it is bullish. In order for that to happen, the price of the underlying stock has been above the 200-day MA for some time and that support level is confirmed. This is a fairly reliable technical indicator, but it does not happen that often.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Death_Cross">Death Cross</h2>
<p>When the 50-day MA has been above the 200-day MA and it crosses below the 200-day MA, it is referred to as a Death Cross and it is bearish. In order for this to happen, the stock will also be less than the 200-day MA and it has stayed below it for some time. This validates resistance at the 200-day MA. Traders watch for Golden Crosses and Death Crosses and that makes them relevant. &nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Exponential_Moving_Averages">Exponential Moving Averages</h2>
<p>Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) place greater weight on the more recent data points, so they adjust quickly and they tend to follow the market more closely. Short term traders use the EMA (8) to confirm trend strength/weakness and for entry/exit. For instance, if a trader is long SPY and it is in a nice uptrend they will ride the position until the SPY closes below the EMA (8). If the trader is short SPY they will stick with the short and they will exit when the EMA (8) is breached to the upside. This is effectively a trailing stop. Very short-term traders also use a EMA (3)/EMA (8) cross for entry and exit.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I do not use MAs for any time frame other than a daily chart. What makes the MAs relevant is that other traders use them and I do not feel they are as widely used on shorter time frames. I use other indicators on a short-term basis and I have found them to be more reliable.</p>
