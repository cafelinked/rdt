<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Zoom out and identify the pattern. Then determine your micro trading game plan.</h4>
<p>For those of you who have been at this for more than a year, you’ve learned a lot. The tendency is to use all of your analytical skills and tools to nail every move. Here are a couple of likely scenarios you might find yourself in and a solution that will keep you on the straight and narrow.&nbsp;<strong>This could be one of the most important lessons you learn from me.</strong></p>
<p>The first scenario is the FOMO trader. The market is breaking out to a new 52-week high and they are ready to buy anything that moves. They are looking for stocks that are breaking out through technical resistance on heavy volume and that have relative strength. When the market gaps up and the stock is stacking green candles, they buy the stock in the first 30 minutes of the day. After a couple of hours they regret that decision. The market and the stock have pulled back and they could have entered better. The market action dies down and the stock lost its momentum. Now they are stuck with an overnight trade that they did not plan on swing trading. After a couple of days, the stock has given back some of its gains and they take a loss. In some cases it gets back to their entry price and they scratch it. What happened? Everything looked so great and then it turned to mush right after they got in. This scenario can be very frustrating and they are left wondering what they could have done differently.</p>
<p>The next scenario is the contrarian trader. They wonder how the heck the market got this high when the Fed is still raising rates and when inflation is still running way above the 2% target. Two of the largest bank failures have happened this year and there could be a credit crisis. There is plenty of selling pressure and they can see that in the sluggish price action. When the market surges higher, much of the gain is erased in the next few days. They sense that the market move higher is going to run out of steam at some point and there are signs of resistance. Last Friday the market had a down day and it came after it made a 52-week high. This could be the first sign of a top so they start to take some short positions. Red candles off of a relative high often produce a pullback and we can see that on a D1 chart. As the profit taking continues, the market drifts lower and they add to short positions. Out of nowhere, the market gaps higher on the open just when the short positions were starting to gain traction. They know they are trading against the trend and they did not get the breakdown so they take a loss.</p>
<p>“I can’t buy and I can’t short, so what in the hell am I supposed to do?”</p>
<p>The first thing you have to do is to take a giant step backwards. Get the longer term market context and understand the prevailing price action. The market has a tendency to continue to do what it has been doing. You just need to figure out a game plan that will take advantage of the current price action.</p>
<p>In the chart below you can see the prevailing market trend. You can draw a nice upward sloping D1 trendline. When you do that the market direction is clear. We couldn’t say that at the beginning of the year because the market was still forming a base. As you draw those trendlines, you will notice lots of mixed green and red candles with overlap and there are many periods where the volume is low. This tells you that we are in a choppy trend higher. The market takes three steps forward and two steps backwards. There are plenty of opportunities to get long and there are always second chances to enter the trade. This realization allows you to take a deep breath. The next time you have the urge to chase, you need to realize that there will be a better entry point. This market is not off to the races. Chasing breakouts is nerve wracking and every time you do it, the stock pulls back and you have to take heat. You convince yourself that this is “normal” and you prepare yourself for it. You might have even conditioned yourself to expect the position to move against you. The solution to this is pretty easy and for many of you, the tactic I am about to explain could turn your trading around.</p>

<p>Buy dips and take gains when the bounce stalls. Repeat.</p>
<p>Bear markets are pretty rare and many of you honed your skills during one. That is excellent because you have respect for the market and you understand that it can move both ways. You also appreciate the importance of “Market First”. This knowledge makes you different from all of the other traders who went bust last year or those who are just getting started now and who will only know a bull market. Unfortunately, there is some “post tramatic stress disorder (PTSD)” that you have to work off. Make no mistake, the market has formed a base and it is grinding higher.</p>
<p>So the pattern is very easy to see on a longer-term chart. The market takes three steps forward and two steps backwards. The problem is that most breakouts happen on the third step forwards. You see the technical breakout and that relative high is what gets the stock on your radar. It has heavy volume and relative strength so you buy. Then the stock loses its momentum and you get scared. Because you are buying a breakout, the next level of support is far away once that breakout fails. You have done your “walk away” analysis and you know your picks are solid. You will just have to weather the storm… again. The drop in the stock is nerve wracking, but you stick it out. During that process you wonder why you always seem to enter trades poorly. When the stock does come back to your entry price, you are on “pins and needles” and you think to yourself, “I am not going to let it go against me again.” At the first sign of trouble, you pull the plug. Then you watch the stock stage a nice rally and you are on the sidelines fuming. So how do we solve this problem?</p>
<p>The key is in that D1 chart I posted above. The breakout is nice and it gets the stock on our radar, but there is no follow through. Instead of jumping on the stock during that breakout, be ready to buy dips. If you look at the vast majority of stocks on a D1 and an M5 chart, the candles are not all green. There is a mix of red and green candles. That means that stocks do not go straight up and that there are pullbacks. Now you just have to figure out a way to get alerts when the stock pulls back and it forms support.</p>
<p>I have a couple of favorite variables I like to use. RS/RW is one and LRSI is another. When I see a strong stock, I set an alert and I do not take a position. If I am day trading, the stock is typically strong when I spot it. M5 RS/RW is &gt; 0 and M5 LRSI is &gt; 80. I want to know when M5 RS/RW has gone &lt; 0 and then &gt;0. That is the dip I am looking for and I will be alerted when it happens. If I am using M5 LRSI and it goes &lt; 20 and then &gt; 20, I will get an alert. The beauty of the alert is that it did not cost me a dime to set it. I can keep searching for new prospects. I have no emotional attachment to the stock because I have no position. I am also not tying up capital, I do not have to manage the position and I retain complete control. When the alert is triggered, I can evaluate the market and the stock and then decide if I want to take the trade or if I want to reset the alert. If the market has been in a steady and organized down trend while I am waiting, I am not likely to take the trade and I will set another alert. In this situation, I would like to see the stock holding its own. That is what stocks with relative strength do and I know that it will be a great prospect when the market finds support. The dip in the stock will provide me with an excellent entry point. I will wait until I have market support and when I do buy the stock, I will know that when the market rebounds I will have a tailwind. I will also know that the stock wants to move higher. If you do not have this alert functionality in your current platform, take the Option Stalker Pro free trial. It has been a game changer for many traders and the user interface is easy to learn.</p>
<p>This is a time to add longer term swing trades to your trading game plan. For these trades you use a longer time frame like M30 or H1. You want the dip in the stock to be significant. That pullback will put you closer to a support level you can lean on so your stops can be tighter. You will also be able to gauge the upside potential because the stock is likely to challenge the recent high. Know that you have been able to pick great stocks. Your walk away analysis bears that out. It is just a matter of time until buyers return. When they do, you will be entering at a great price.</p>
<p>Your entire mental state will change if you use this approach. Instead of chasing, you will retain control at all times. You will set the alert and wait for that dip. Then you will evaluate what happened from time you set the alert until the time it was triggered. What did the stock do? What did the market do? Does everything still look good? Did the stock find support? When you take that trade you will have a very high level of confidence. You will also understand that the market and the stock are not going to go straight up. Set similar alerts for the upside. If the stock loses its relative strength M5, an alert is triggered. If it still looks good, set another alert. Set an M5 alert so that if LRSI goes &gt; 80 and then it falls below 80 it is triggered. A triggered exit alert does not mean you have to bail on the position; you are simply evaluating the price movement. Take gains when the momentum stalls and then wait for the next dip.</p>
<p>How do I know if the dip still has more downside? If you see stacked red candles and heavy volume, it is a sign that there is heavy selling pressure. Then you need to expect more selling. Reset the alerts and consider using an M15 or M30 time frame. If the stock has mixed overlapping candles and light volume on the pullback and if the drop is brief and shallow, it still has buyers and support will form quickly. When you see this you know you are close to taking action.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the article I mentioned a second scenario. It is the contrarian trader who is always looking for a market top. It is important to be aware of the fundamental market forces that are in play, but learn to trade what is in front of you and not what you think. The sooner you realize that you don’t know shit… the better. Until we see a long red candle closing through that up trendline on very heavy volume, you have to trade as if every dip is a buying opportunity. The vast majority of you should not even think about the short side right now (shorting is only for seasoned Pros). The market is in an uptrend and the spikes higher can be violent. When they happen, you are trying to manage losses on shorts instead of focusing on new long positions. Keep it simple and don’t short.</p>
<p>The market has regained its footing after 2022 and the price action has been bullish… so roll with it. Don’t buy breakouts, set alerts instead. When the alerts are triggered, reevaluate the market and the stock. If all looks good, take the trade. You should have a market tailwind and natural strength in the stock to fuel the move higher. As you get back to the recent high, watch the price action. If the stock powers through, wait for the momentum to stall and take gains.</p>
<p>This is your roadmap. I hope this lesson helps. To watch a video I recorded with an example&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcJRfq0bisg&amp;t=61s" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.</p>
