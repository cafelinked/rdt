<p>There are an incredible number of technical indicators that measure price and volume, but there is nothing as “pure” as being able to read price action. Indicators are based on a theory and they require computation. It is critically important to understand the theory behind the indicator and to have faith in it. Without trust, an indicator is worthless. That trust is established over time and with extensive testing. Many indicators work well in certain situations and they do not perform well in others. Often, the variables for the indicator need to be adjusted to suit a trader’s style or to adapt to changing market conditions. Rule bases need to be established to improve signal reliability. All indicators require historical data and consequently they are backwards looking. Learn how to read price action and you will not have these issues.</p>
<p>Each candlestick is a paragraph with its own supply and demand message. When candlesticks are combined, they teach a lesson, much like a chapter in textbook. When you finish reading the book, you understand the relevance of each chapter and you are ready to apply what you have learned. Reading price action requires practice. The same concepts apply to longer term charts and shorter term charts and you do not have to understand variables, calculations or limitations like you do for indicators. The last candlestick has meaning. It tells you if the storyline is continuing on the same path or if it is changing. That makes this method of technical analysis current. Throughout my career I have studied and used many indicators. I have even developed my own (1OP). I have not found any indicator that predicts price movement as well as being able to read price action.</p>
<p>I am going to cover this concept in great detail and it will be one of the longer educational sections in The System. There are some nuances for very short-term trading using five minute charts and I will cover them extensively in that section. Let’s start with longer term analysis of SPY and I will show you how we can read price action to help us determine market direction.</p>
