<h4 class="wp-block-heading">This is a description of the variables you will find in the lower section of Custom Search and how to use them.</h4>
<p>The lower section of Custom Search has a different set of powerful variables that can be used in concert with the variables in the upper section. In this article I will describe each of them and their relevance when searching for the strongest and weakest stocks. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stock_Profile">Stock Profile</h2>
<p>These general stock characteristics are used to filter out stocks that do not fit the profile you are looking for. Here is a description of each field. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stock.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="40fc2d9d-12df-489e-b1b7-cc5abd887363">

                    </div>
                
<p><strong>Price</strong></p>
<p>Some traders like to trade stocks that are less than $10 and other traders like to trade stocks that are over $30. What ever your preference, you can use this variable to define the price range for the stocks you are interested in.</p>
<p><strong>Option IV( ATM)</strong></p>
<p>Option implied volatilities (IVs) are calculated each day after the close. We take the front month regular expiration and we average the option IV for at the money calls and puts. Traders can set the lower and upper range. Traders who like to buy option premium will want to set the range between .01 and .35. These are considered to be relatively “cheap”. Traders who like to sell option premium should set the range from .35 to 1.00. These options will be relatively “expensive” and the trader will be able to distance themselves from the action by selling far out of the money options. The goal is to take advantage of time premium decay. I use this filter when I am looking for bullish put spreads and I set the value greater than .35. If the market is in a strong long-term up trend I will set this value at .01 to .35 and I will be looking to buy “cheap” calls with a delta of .7 or higher a few months out.</p>
<p><strong>Average Volume</strong></p>
<p>In general, I won’t even consider a stock where the 20-day average daily volume is less than a million shares. Liquidity is very important when you are trying to enter and exit the trade. Stocks that have low volume also tend to be choppy and they do not have the nice orderly price action I am looking for. The numbers are expressed in thousands so 1,000 = 1,000,000.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Options</strong></p>
<p>Stocks that are active have weekly options and they tend to have liquid options markets. The bid/ask spread is tighter making it easier to enter and exit trades. If I am looking for earnings calendar spreads, the stock must have weekly options. If I am selling out of the money bullish put spreads, I want the flexibility to chose from various expiration dates and I will use this filter. Traders who are searching for “lotto” trades on Friday will also want to use this filter since they are trading options that will expire in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>ATR</strong></p>
<p>Some traders favor volatile stocks while others avoid volatility. This variable calculates the 20-day ATR and it divides that by the price of the stock. That tells us the daily percentage move we can expect for the stock. A daily average range of 2.5% or less would be a stable stock. Stocks in the 2.5% to 3.5% would have normal volatility. Stocks in the 3.5% to 4.5% range would be considered volatile and stocks that are above 5% are considered very volatile.</p>
<p><strong>IV Spike</strong></p>
<p>Spikes in option implied volatility (IV) indicate uncertainty. Option IVs will spike when the stock makes a big move and we can see that move in the chart. When the stock has not moved much and the option IVs are spiking, it is a sign that news is pending. It could be clinical trial results for a new drug, litigation, a new product launch or an earnings release. Option IVs don’t increase by mistake. Market Makers are very aware of these events and traders can avoid costly mistakes by using this filter. In general, avoid trading stocks with rising IVs. Chances are there is a binary event on the horizon and we don’t know the outcome. We want to avoid situations where our odds are 50:50 because we can do much better than that trading stocks that have relative strength, technical breakouts, heavy volume and no news pending.</p>
<p><strong>Option Liquidity Rating</strong></p>
<p>We have a proprietary method for calculating option liquidity and it ranges from -10 to +15. The bid/ask spread, the daily option volume, open interest and the availability of weekly options are a some of the variables we use. If the option liquidity rating is less than -4, it is considered poor and you should favor trading shares of stock. A rating from -3 to 0 is adequate and you should be able to execute 10- 20 contracts without an issue. You should try to “split” the bid/ask spread. A rating from 1 – 4 is excellent and you can trade larger size. Stocks with a rating above 5 have excellent option liquidity and you can trade 100 contracts without much if any market impact. In general, we want good option liquidity, but know that you will be eliminating many great prospects if you set this value above 5. There simply aren’t that many stocks that have fantastic option liquidity. </p>
<p><strong>Only ETFs</strong></p>
<p>Some traders only want to trade ETFs and they should select this variable to filter out stocks. </p>
<p><strong>No ETFs</strong></p>
<p>Some traders don’t want to trade ETFs and they want to focus on the strongest stocks. Often, contra ETFs will find their way into the searches and this filter will eliminate them. For instance, if I am looking for a strong stock when the market is down, I might have bearish contra ETFs included in the list. They are moving higher because the market is down and by selecting this variable I can filter them out.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Action_Today">Action Today</h2>
<p>This section focuses on the current day’s price action and it is primarily used by day traders. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Action.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="3c546af3-411e-468f-a0b9-b5ecf58d3a55">

                        <div class="h6 fst-italic mt-3 mt-md-0 ms-md-4 gallery-caption"></div>
                    </div>
                
<p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
<p>Traders can set a minimum threshold for the volume today. This is slightly different from the volume filter using the 20-day average volume. There will be times when a stock is dormant and it has low volume. News hits and the volume spikes today. The 20-day average volume filter might eliminate the prospect, but this filter will allow it to pass through if it meets your minimum volume requirement. </p>
<p><strong>SMA Cross</strong></p>
<p>If you select this variable, the first click will default to bullish. We’ve combined all 3 of the major moving averages into one variable. The stock was below the 50-day, 100-day or 200-day MA yesterday and today it is above that moving average. If you click the variable a second time, it will shift to bearish. The stock was above the 50-day, 100-day or 200-day MA yesterday and today it is below that moving average. If you click the variable a third time, the box will not be selected. Many of our variables have a bullish or bearish setting. When you click a variable and it is green (bullish), you know that if you click it again it will be red (bearish).</p>
<p><strong>RVOL</strong></p>
<p>This study takes the average 5 minute volume for each M5 increment and it averages that volume over a 20-day period. Then we add all of the M5 increments that have elapsed during the day to find the average volume to that point in the trading day and we compare it to the current volume. If the current volume is greater than the 20-day average volume for the elapsed time, the stock has greater than average relative volume. Users can increase or decrease this value. If you want to find a stock that has 200% of its normal average volume you can raise the value to 2.00. These stocks are sure to have news so make sure you check for it. Volume is a critical component. It tells us that institutions are active and that the move is legitimate and sustainable. This is an essential variable to use when the market is dull. The stock will have to do all of the heavy lifting and heavy volume indicates that institutions are active.</p>
<p><strong>VWAP</strong></p>
<p>If you multiply the price of every trade today by its volume and then divide that number by the total shares traded today, you get the volume weighted average price (VWAP). This is an important price point and it is used by institutions. Asset Managers will give orders to executing brokers like Citadel who will honor the VWAP for the fill price. In doing so, the Asset Manager does not have execution risk. Firms like Citadel have sophisticated algorithms and programs that help them execute these trades during the day. Many professional traders devise trading strategies around VWAP. In general, a stock that is above VWAP is considered to be bullish and a stock that is below VWAP is considered to be bearish. This variable allows us to search for these stocks. Click VWAP once and it will look for stocks that are above VWAP. Click VWAP twice and it will look for stocks that are below VWAP.</p>
<p><strong>Prior Day RVOL</strong></p>
<p>Specify stock with RVOL of the previous trading day between a certain range. This is a nice variable because it tells us that the stock had active buyers/sellers the day before. This is even more powerful when the relative volume today is above average. Those same traders are back for more and the move has a higher likelihood of being legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>Prior Day High/Low</strong></p>
<p>This is one of my favorite variables. I rarely buy a stock that is not above the prior day’s high. That is the first resistance level and if the stock can’t even get above it, I have no interest in trading it. Remember, we want stocks that have lots of room to run. Let’s say that the market is in a nasty decline today. I will often run a search to find stocks that are above the prior day’s high. This is such a simple and powerful search to run and it is a sign of true relative strength. On a day when most stocks are suffering from heavy losses, this stock is up on the day and it is above the prior day’s high. When the market finds support, this stock is sure to run higher. It might take the market a few days to find support so set an alert at a nearby resistance level for the stock and you will know when it is staging the next leg higher. </p>
<p><strong>Volatility Today</strong></p>
<p>If a stock has greater than average volatility, it might have news that is driving the action. The normal 20-day ATR is 1.00. If you set the value to 1.50, the stock will have exceeded the normal daily range by 50%. If you combine this with RVOL, you have a stock that is making big moves on heavy volume. </p>
<p><strong>New High/Low of Day</strong></p>
<p>These stocks made a new high of the day or a new low of the day in the last 5 minutes and we can search for them. You can zero in on the strongest/weakest stocks very quickly. Imagine that the market has been strong during the day, but it just had a small retracement. When you look for a stock that is making a new high for the day it tells you this stock was oblivious to the market dip and that buyers are lined up. This is also a variable you can add to the custom column layouts. When you have many stocks in a search, this column will reveal the strongest stocks in a quick glance.</p>
<p><strong>% Today’s Range</strong></p>
<p>This variable measures where the stock is relative to the range for the day. For instance, if you are looking for a stock that is near the high of the day, you would set a range of 90 to 100. That would mean that it is in the upper 10% of the range for the day. If you set a range of 1 to 10, the stock would be in the lower 10% of its daily range. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Daily_Range">Daily Range</h2>
<p>This section focuses on longer-term price levels. When we day trade, we want to make sure that the stock is in a longer-term up trend. We always want to day trade stocks that look good on a swing basis. Of course these variables are important to longer-term swing traders as well.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Daily.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="bcd8f468-996f-4538-9084-7e939ea63c34">

                        <div class="h6 fst-italic mt-3 mt-md-0 ms-md-4 gallery-caption"></div>
                    </div>
                
<p><strong>% 60-day Range</strong></p>
<p>This variable will help you find stocks that are at one of the extremes of the 60-day range. If you were looking for a strong stock, you would want to find stocks that are in the upper 25% of that range. If you were looking for a weak stock, you would want to find stocks that are in the lower 25% of the 60-day range. </p>
<p><strong>Trendline Breakout</strong></p>
<p>This search variable helps us find stocks that have breached an automated trendline in the last 10 days. A bullish breakout could be a High- trendline or a High+ trendline. A bearish breakdown could be a Low+ trendline or a Low- trendline. When viewing the search results we suggest adding 1OTL Now to your D1 charts so that you can see the breach. Click this variable once for a bullish breakout and twice for a bearish breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>SMA 200</strong></p>
<p>If you click this variable once, the stock will be above the 200-day SMA (bullish). If you click it twice, it would be bearish with the stock below the 200-day SMA.</p>
<p><strong>AVWAPE</strong></p>
<p>This variable is the volume weighted average price since the earnings release (AVWAPE). VWAP is anchored to that date. After studying this concept for two years, I find this variable to be relevant. Imagine that you are a large Asset Manager. You liked the earnings release, but you know that entering a large position would impact the price. You hand the order off to a firm like Citadel and you provide them with a deadline to fill the order. Citadel will be closely monitoring the AVWAPE and they will try to fill the order at that price (or better). I view AVWAPE to be as significant as any of the major moving averages.</p>
<p><strong>SMA 100</strong></p>
<p>If you click this variable once, the stock will be above the 100-day SMA (bullish). If you click it twice, it would be bearish with the stock below the 100-day SMA.</p>
<p><strong>AVWAPQ</strong></p>
<p>This is the volume weighted average price since the start of the quarter (AVWAPQ). We use the day after triple witching (third Friday in March, June, September and December) to anchor this variable. Asset Managers are often “window dressing” their portfolios into the end of the quarter and this is when they are making allocation decisions. I find this variable to be particularly relevant for indices since they do not have earnings announcements and those futures contracts “roll over” on triple witching.</p>
<p><strong>SMA 50</strong></p>
<p>If you click this variable once, the stock will be above the 50-day SMA (bullish). If you click it twice, it would be bearish with the stock below the 50-day SMA.</p>
<p><strong>20-day High/Low</strong></p>
<p>This allows us to find stocks that are making a new 20-day High or a new 20-day Low.</p>
<p><strong>SMA 20</strong></p>
<p>If you click this variable once, the stock will be above the 20-day SMA. If you click it twice, it would be bearish with the stock below the 20-day SMA.</p>
<p><strong>52-Week High/Low</strong></p>
<p>This variable allows us to find stocks that are making a new 52-week High or a 52-week Low. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Earnings">Earnings</h2>
<p>We trade around earnings announcements and these variables are very important and powerful. We have tracked stocks for 3 years and we know which ones have statistically rallied into earnings and which ones tend to sell off. The earnings reactions can be bullish or bearish and often the stock does not show its true colors for a couple of weeks. We can structure our searches to find stocks that have been strong/weak after posting results. These searches can also be used to plan longer-term trades like bullish put spreads.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/earnings.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="0f2a90cb-2d5d-414c-bf58-e992468ec8de">

                    </div>
                
<p><strong>Pre-Earnings Bull/Bear</strong></p>
<p>Click this variable once and you will get the bullish setting. These stocks will report earnings in less than two weeks and in the last 3 years they have rallied into the number more than 75% of the time once they get inside of this window. Look for stocks that have not run hard and that might attract buyers ahead of the announcement. Consider selling ATM weekly put credit spreads that expire before the number on these stocks. This is the preferred strategy because the market typically rallies into earnings season and you will have that tailwind.</p>
<p>Click this variable a second time and you will get the bearish setting. These stocks will report earnings in less than two weeks and in the last 3 years, they have declined into the number more than 75% of the time once they get inside of this window. Look for stocks that have not tanked and that might attract sellers ahead of the announcement. Consider selling weekly ATM call credit spreads that expire before the number on these stocks. Make sure that the market is trending lower if you use this strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Earnings Today</strong></p>
<p>This search variable will help you identify companies that announce earnings after the close today or before the open tomorrow. This is a great search to run during the heat of earnings season. Check your current positions and be mindful of stocks that are in the same group as your holdings.</p>
<p><strong>Projected Earnings</strong></p>
<p>Use this variable to see which companies will be announcing soon. You can define the date range and plan for the release. In some instances, you might want to find expected release dates that are well into the future so that you can sell near term credit spreads without worrying that they will span an announcement. We want credit spreads to expire before earnings. When we buy options we want the options to expire after the announcement so that they retain their premium. These options will be less vulnerable to premium decay because the IVs will stay elevated.</p>
<p><strong>Post Earnings Today</strong></p>
<p>This search variable will help you identify which companies announced earnings after the close the prior day or before the open today. Use this in conjunction with other variables like: &gt; Prior Day High, Compression Out, High- Trendline Breach to confirm strong earnings reactions. &nbsp;Did you just gloss over that last sentence? Don’t just read the words in this article, understand the concepts and try to visualize them. Take a moment and think about what those other variables represent and why it might be good to include them.</p>
<p><strong>No Earnings Within</strong></p>
<p>This is an effective search variable when we are looking for longer-term trades. If the market is in a strong trend and we want to take a longer-term position, we want to make sure earnings are as far off in the future as possible. Even for shorter-term trades that might span a few weeks, we can avoid having to exit prematurely because the stock is about to report in a few days. Stocks can be volatile as the earnings release approaches and this variable helps us avoid stocks where the price action could be choppy.</p>
<p><strong>Post Earnings Bull/Bear</strong></p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that stocks often take a couple of weeks to show their true colors after reporting earnings. The bullish setting for this variable looks for stocks that have reported in the last two weeks, that rallied on the news and that are trading above the opening price after the earnings release. The bearish setting looks for stocks that dropped on the news and that are trading below the opening price after the earnings release. </p>
<p><strong>Prior Earnings</strong></p>
<p>We can search for stocks that have recently reported earnings using this variable. It can be combined with other variables to find stocks that are strong or weak after the earnings release. Earnings announcements have a very powerful impact on the stock price and the guidance often sets to tone for the entire quarter. </p>
<p><strong>No Prior Earnings</strong></p>
<p>If the company has recently reported earnings, we can exclude it from our searches. Remember, we like to wait at least a week before we take a position after an earnings report. The stock will often chop around before its true direction is revealed. This variable helps us to avoid this volatility.</p>
