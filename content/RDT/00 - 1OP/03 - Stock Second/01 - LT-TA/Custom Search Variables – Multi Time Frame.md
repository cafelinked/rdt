<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Search variables that can be defined as bullish or bearish appear in the upper section Custom Search. Here’s an explanation of what they look for and when to use them.</h4>
<p>In this section, we will look at some of the ways you can pinpoint the best stocks using our Custom Search variables. You should be familiar with the technical patterns we seek from the previous articles and now we will describe how each variable can help you to find them. Our search engine is incredibly powerful and you can combine the variables across multiple time frames for additional confirmation. Match the time frames to your intended trade duration. Users click the variable once for bullish, a second time for bearish and a third time to deselect it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Relative_Strength_Market_">Relative Strength (Market)</h2>
<p>Real Relative Strength/Weakness vs SPY measures how strong the stock is relative to the SPY. This indicator is our “edge” and that is why it is at the top of Custom Search. It subtracts the percentage gain for the stock from the percentage gain for the SPY. A positive number reflects relative strength and a negative number reflects relative weakness. Vincent Bruzzese (aka HariSeldon) made a modification to our original calculation and we have adopted it. The result is adjusted to account for normal volatility in the stock. A stock that has greater volatility relative to the SPY will move more and it will give the appearance of greater relative strength. We want to factor that out to get a true representation of relative strength. </p>
<p>Why is RRS/RRW so powerful? I hope by now you know the answer to this question. This is the ultimate “tell” that institutions are buying/selling the stock. At very minimum for all of your searches (day or swing), D1 should be marked. For bullish day trades we want to make sure that the stock has longer-term strength and when the stock has RRS on a D1 basis we have some reassurance that the stock has support in the form of institutional buying. RRS/RRW are even better when they are used across multiple time frames. If you are day trading a stock it must have RRS M5 if you are buying it. If we get the market wrong and the SPY declines, a stock with real relative strength will hold up much better than the market and other stocks. When the market rallies, a stock with RRS will lead the charge higher. There will be instances where the stock gaps up. It has run so far so fast that it can’t keep up that pace. RRS will start to decline, but that does not mean the stock is weak. As long as RRS is greater than zero, the stock is strong relative to the market. For large gaps up, an effective entry method is to wait for the stock to dip and for RRS to go below zero. I personally like stocks that are able to preserve the VWAP and the low of the day on that dip. Ideally, the dip does not retrace more than half of the gains from the open to the high of the day. Those are the strongest stocks. When RRS goes back above zero, it will provide a nice entry for your long. On very short-term time frames the stock can go from RRS to RRW. That is another reason to only trade stocks that have RRS on a D1 basis. We need to know that institutions have been buying that stock in recent days. The first chart below has a stock that is in a strong D1 up trend. It gaps higher overnight and it holds the open of the day. It recovers its strength and it adds to the gains. In the second chart below, the stock is weak on a D1 basis and sellers take advantage of the gap up. They crush the stock like a little bug and it never recovers. This is why we want a strong D1 chart. </p>

<p>Another effective way to use the RRS/RRW indicator is to have it selected across multiple time frames for confirmation. This is the basis for the Green Royal Flush and Red Royal Flush searches. In the example below, you can see how the D1 chart is attractive with the stock having multiple breakouts through resistance. As we look at all of the other time frames, we can also see the strength across all time frames. This stock has buyers and the dips are minor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Relative_Strength_Sector_">Relative Strength (Sector)</h2>
<p>Here we are measuring the stock’s real relative strength vs the sector that it belongs to. We use the 11 sector groupings for this calculation and it is in accordance with the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) which was developed in 1999 by MSCI and Standard &amp; Poor’s.&nbsp;The sectors are Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), Technology (XLK), Materials (XLB), Consumer Staples (XLP), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Industrials (XLI), Communications (XLC), Healthcare (XLV), Financials (XLF) and Real Estate (XLRE). We use the ETF to measure the performance of the sector and even though the stock might not be a component in the actual ETF, this is a good benchmark for calculating RRS/RRW vs the sector. We perform the same calculation used for RRS/RRS vs SPY and we adjust for the volatility of the stock compared to the sector ETF. </p>
<p>Why is this so powerful? This is another level of confirmation. If the stock is strong relative to the market (SPY) and to the sector, institutions are buying it. In the previous article about the characteristics of a stock, I discussed some of the limitations of sector strength. Not all companies can be compartmentalized so the sector “fit” is often far from perfect. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Trade_Signal">Trade Signal</h2>
<p>Developing accurate trade signals has been one of my greatest challenges. The development, testing and refinement process has taken more than a decade. The trade signals are proprietary and you can only get them here. </p>
<p>Trade signals can become the cornerstone to your directional bias once trust is established. That takes time and you need proof that they work under all trading conditions. </p>
<p>Traditional indicators used in the industry lag price movement. Consequently, these indicators are late and useless. By the time the indicator triggers a signal, the move is over. </p>
<p>Trade signals need to be timely. We have devised many ways to measure price action and they help us predict price movement. Any one can make this claim, but our 1OP Indicator has proven itself for many years. Our bullish and bearish crosses occur well before the inflection point and we see that on a daily basis. We’ve incorporated components of 1OP into our trade signals. This is critically important because we want to catch trend reversals as early as possible. </p>
<p>When you try our trade signals, you will notice that the entry is excellent. That instant cushion allows you to place your stop at your entry price giving you limited downside risk and plenty of upside potential. </p>
<p>Accurate trade signals also help you manage the trade. Our trade signals are sensitive. If the stock is not performing, an exit signal will trigger and you will be able to minimize losses. </p>
<p>Most traders exit trades too early and they cut their profits short. If an exit signal has not been triggered, keep riding the move until you have one. The fear of giving profits back scares many traders and they panic out on the first red candle. Knowing that the trade signals are sensitive will give you the confidence you need to stay in the trade. The signals won’t let your profits slip away.</p>
<p>Avoid stocks that are trapped in a horizontal trading range or that are compressing. This is true for any indicator or trade signal. Instead, look for stocks that are breaking out or that are trending.</p>
<p>It really doesn’t matter what I say about our trade signals. I developed them so of course I think they are fantastic. Test them visually using the arrows on the charts. Ease in and gradually start trading them. In time you will trust them and I’m confident they will become a cornerstone for your trading. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Trade_Signal_New_">Trade Signal (New)</h2>
<p>The Trade Signal was triggered in the prior period or the one before that. This is useful if you are trying to catch a move that is just getting started.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Compression_Breakout">Compression Breakout</h2>
<p>This means that the stock was in a tight horizontal trading range and now it has broken out. A bullish Compression Out means the stock has broken through horizontal resistance and it is trading above that level. A bearish Compression Out means the stock has broken below the low end of the horizontal trading range. The longer and tighter the compression, the bigger and more sustained the release. You can see compressions on the chart by using 1OSqz. The yellow dots tell you the stock is compressing, the red and green dots mean the stock made a big move out of the compression and the gray dots mean the stock is not compressing (normal volatility). Stocks that are compressing have been dormant and they are like coiled springs. The beauty of trading compressions is that option premiums are fairly cheap because the stock has been “dead wood.” You also don’t have to worry that the move is over-extended. On the breakout, it is just getting started so there is room to run. The biggest danger is that the breakout does not gain traction and that the stock gets sucked back into the range. That is why we need heavy volume breakouts with a long candle or a gap out of the range. The “escape velocity” is critical and we want immediate follow through. What ever the news is, it has thrown the stock out of equilibrium and there will be a price discovery process. If the move is higher, shorts will cover and longs will buy more.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Compression_Breakout_New_">Compression Breakout (New)</h2>
<p>This search variable means that the stock was in a compression and that it broke out of the range the previous period or the one before that. We want to catch these breakouts early, so this is a great variable to use for your searches. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Key_Bar">Key Bar</h2>
<p>We’ve previously discussed Key Bars in the Market section of this course. When a green candle has a larger than average range, the volume is greater than average and the candle closes near its high, it is relevant. That is a sign of aggressive buying and these candles often lead to follow through buying. If this search variable is bullish, the prior bar or the one before that was a green Key Bar. If this variable is bearish, the prior bar or the one before that was a red Key Bar. This is another variable we can use for confirmation. Sometimes, the Key Bar will be at the beginning of the move and it can signal a reversal and sometimes it can be in the middle of the range signaling continuation. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo__8_Crossover">3/8 Crossover</h2>
<p>This is a very basic technical pattern use by many traders. When the 3 period exponential moving average (EMA) crosses above the 8 period EMA, a buy signal is generated. When the 3 period EMA crosses below the 8 period EMA, a sell signal is generated. This signal can be used to pinpoint entries and exits. For instance, if you found an excellent stock with a strong D1 chart, you might wait for the EMA 3 to cross over the EMA 8 before you enter the trade. You would stay in the trade until the EMA 3 crosses back below the EMA8. If the stock is trapped in a range or if the trend is not strong, this method will produce many false entries and exits. The slippage (cost of entering and exiting the trade) adds up quickly and you are forced to navigate bid/ask spreads and commissions. The 3/8 cross overs are too sensitive for my personal taste, but many traders rely on them so we included them in our search variables.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Range_90_10_">Range % (90/10)</h2>
<p>This variable compares where the last price is relative to the range of the current bar for that time frame. This is less relevant for an M5 bar because of the short time frame. It is more useful for longer time frames like H1. If you wanted to look for stocks that are above the 90% of the H1 bar, you would select the bullish version of this variable. Let’s suppose the market had been selling off during the last hour, you might want to see which stocks are trading near the high end of the range. That would be another way of finding relative strength. If you wanted to find stocks that are trading in the lower 10% of the H1 range you would select the bearish version of the variable. These stocks have been in a steady decline and they are leading the move lower. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ADX">ADX</h2>
<p>This is the Average Directional Index (ADX) developed by Welles Wilder. It is very commonly used and it measures trend strength. </p>
<p>Directional movement is&nbsp;<strong>positive</strong>&nbsp;(plus) when the current high minus the prior high is greater than the prior low minus the current low. This is called Plus Directional Movement (+DM). A negative value would simply be entered as zero.</p>
<p>Directional movement is&nbsp;<strong>negative</strong>&nbsp;(minus) when the prior low minus the current low is greater than the current high minus the prior high. This is called Minus Directional Movement (-DM). A negative value would simply be entered as zero.</p>
<p>Let’s keep this simple. For those of you who really want to dive into the calculations, you can search for ADX and find a wealth of information about it. We are comparing the high from the current candle to the high from the previous candle and the low from the current candle to the low from the previous candle. If the highs overpower the lows, it is a +DI. If the lows overpower the highs it is a -DI. These values are averaged (smoothed). When the +DI is rising and the minus -DI is falling, the spread between the two values (ADX) is increasing and the stock is in an up trend. When the -DI is rising and the +DI is falling, the spread between them is increasing and that indicates that the stock is in a down trend. Typically, an ADX value greater than 25 signifies that the stock is in a strong directional trend. Since we are momentum traders, this is a very powerful way to measure trend strength. Because there is a value, we can also quantify it and search for it.</p>
<p>There are a couple of drawbacks to using ADX. One is that it tends to be very late. Often by the time it gets to a value of 25, the trend is exhausted. After a long trend that suddenly reverses, it also takes a fair amount of time for the ADX value to start rising again. You can see this in the chart below. Off of the low for the stock, the +DI and the -DI start to converge. Eventually they cross, but it takes time for the +DI to rise well above the -DI. ADX is just starting to gain traction when the stock bounce is starting to crest. For this reason, ADX is a great confirming indicator much like the buy and sell signals.</p>
<p>There are many ways to use ADX as a search variable. From a swing standpoint, we want stocks that are in a strong trend. A stock that is in a strong uptrend with relative strength and that has a breakout on heavy volume is likely to continue higher. On a very short term basis, we can use Heavy Volume Today, relative strength, greater than prior day’s high and bullish ADX M5 to find great call “lottos” in the last trading hour of the week. These stocks will have great momentum, and it has a good chance to push through the strike price just before expiration. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="OP_Divergence">1OP Divergence</h2>
<p>This variable is based on the 1OP indicator. When a stock rises during a bullish 1OP cycle, it is in a normal pattern. When a stock declines during a bearish 1OP cycle it is in a normal pattern. This indicator does not always correlate with the underlying stock and these divergences are a sign of trend strength. If a stock is stacking green candles on heavy volume and 1OP is preparing for a bearish cross, wait and see what that bearish cycle produces. If the stock continues to grind higher as 1OP falls, it is confirmation that there is more upside and that a bullish divergence is underway. If the stock has been stacking red candles on heavy volume and a bullish cross is pending, wait to see if that bullish cross produces a bounce in the stock. If it does bounce, you will have a better entry point for your short. If the stock can’t get off the deck during the bullish cycle and it continues to drift lower, a bearish divergence is underway and the stock has more downside. That means the next bearish cross will be good. The key for using this indicator in this fashion is that the stock has movement on heavy volume. Without those two key ingredients, the divergences are much less meaningful. That is why I suggest using this in conjunction with other variables like RRV, Key Bars, RRS/RRW, SMI and LRSI. We need to make sure that the stock has many of the other characteristics we look for. 1OP has been optimized for day trading, so we would suggest only using it for short term intraday time frames (M5-M30).</p>

<p>The variables in the upper portion of Custom Search are binary (bullish/bearish or yes/no) and the matrix gives us the flexibility to combine variables and to match time frames to our trade duration. Each variable has unique characteristics and if you learn how each of them work, you can find any stock. Hopefully, this article provided you with that information. When you find the “perfect” chart, start creating Custom Searches to see which variables pinpointed the stock. This exercise will help you to understand when to use certain variables and which ones work consistently for the pattern you seek. The combinations are almost limitless and you can share your favorite searches with other members in the chat room. In the next article, we will unlock the power of the variables you can select in the lower portion of Custom Search. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="LRSI">LRSI</h2>
<p>Laguerre Relative Strength Index (LRSI) is a filter that was added by John Ehlers to the Relative Strength Index, which was created by Welles Wilder. Before we get started on this topic, RSI is not the edge we trade and it should not be confused with RS/RW. RSI measures the stock’s performance relative to its own previous price movement (against itself). RS/RW measures the stock’s performance relative to the S&amp;P 500. These are two VERY different concepts and it is critically important that you do not confuse them. </p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the rate of change of the underlying stock. After a big move higher, the stock will not be able to maintain the same level of speed and at some point it will decelerate or pause. RSI produces a sell signal when the rate of change slows and it would consider the stock “overbought.” The problem with this indicator is that strong stocks could still have plenty of upside momentum. RSI is often too early and it generates false signals (losses when the position is stopped out). The LRSI filter adds a lagging component that greatly reduces the false signals and when the price action has confirmed sufficiently, it quickly generates a signal. The LRSI standard default is .5 gamma. When the indicator is below 20 and it rises above 20 a buy signal is generated. It remains on that buy signal until it rises above 80. When the indicator falls below 80, a sell signal is generated and it stays on that signal until it falls below 20. Then the cycle starts over. The indicator is “sticky” and when it is above 80, it will stay there for a long period of time. If you have a tendency to exit trades too early, LRSI will help you stick with the position. If you are long and it is above 80, ride that trade. If it is below 20 and you are short, ride that trade. LRSI is excellent at picking reversals and it is good for confirming the move as well. The search is based on the default value (.5 gamma) and we also use the 80/20 parameters for bullish/bearish. Typically, when the indicator crosses below 80, it will promptly go below 20. I like to have that confirmation within 5-6 periods because it signals good downward momentum. The same is true when the indicator rises above 20. We want to see it cross above 80 fairly quickly. If you are adding the indicator to a chart, you might consider increasing the gamma to .70. I prefer this setting. I find that the initial entry might be delayed by a few bars, but once LRSI settles above 80 (or below 20), it tends to stay there and you are not prematurely head faked out of positions. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="LRSI_New_">LRSI (New)</h2>
<p>This Custom Search variable allows us to catch a reversal early. The first condition is that LRSI has been below 20. In the previous period or the one before that, it closed above 20. This would be a bullish signal. Conversely, LRSI has been above 80. In the previous period or the one before that, it closed below 80. That would be a bearish signal. Since the signal is early, it is important to use other indicators that might also confirm the move. They could be trendline breaches, bounces off of major moving averages or an SMI bullish cross (chart below). </p>

<p>If you are trading a bullish reversal, make sure that you are not “picking bottoms” and trading against a very strong down trend. Stocks that have been in a range and that have significant horizontal support are fine. Pullbacks in the middle of the range that find support and then have a bullish LRSI (new) cross are also fine. The signal is in the early stages and that poses greater risk and reward. A bullish cross in a strong downtrend could quickly reverse forming a bearish flag.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="SMI">SMI</h2>
<p>The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) measures momentum, but in a different way. A stock that is in an upward trend will produce bars where the close is above the mid-point of the range for that bar and that finishes in the upper end of the range for the bar. A stock that is in a down trend will produce bars where the close is below the midpoint of the bar and close to the low end of the range for the bar. If we think about the price action we want on the long side, we look for stacked consecutive green candles closing on their high. When that trend is exhausted, the bodies of the candles will compress and the difference between the mid-point of the range and the close will decrease. At the high end of the range, we will also see wicks and the stock closes well off of the high for that bar. Mixed overlapping candles will also be a sign that the trend is weakening. The SMI value will decrease because the indicator measures the close relative to the range for each bar. When the fast line of the indicator passes below the slow line of the indicator, a sell signal is generated. When the fast line of the indicator passes above the slow line, a buy signal is generated. This is one of my favorite indicators because it tends to identify trend changes early. Unlike the Trade Signals and ADX, we can use SMI to identify trend reversals.</p>
<p>One of the draw backs for SMI is that it will generate many false signals when the stock is trapped in a range. This is also common for many other technical indicators. This is why it is important never to rely on one indicator alone. They all measure different aspects of price movement, and we need confirmation across multiple time frames using the same indicator and/or we need to use the indicator in conjunction with other indicators. Learn each of the indicators and then create powerful search combinations. </p>

<p>SMI is a great indicator to use for confirmation that a trend is under way. We want the price action that is consistent with what this indicator measures. We want stocks that are closing close to the high of the bar with little to no retracement. It can be used on any time frame or across multiple time frames. Here is an example of how you would use SMI in conjunction with 1OSqueeze and trendline breaches.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="SMI_New_">SMI (New)</h2>
<p>If the SMI indicator had a bullish or a bearish cross in the last period or the one before that, it will appear in searches where SMI (new) is selected. This will allow us to catch the move when it is just starting. Know that risk and reward go hand in hand. Early signals could be more prone to reverse so make sure you are combining this variable with other indicators for multiple confirmation.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Heiken_Ashi_HA_Continuations">Heiken-Ashi (HA) Continuations</h2>
<p>Here we are looking for two or more consecutive flat top red HA candles to confirm that a strong move lower is in place. Two or more consecutive flat bottom green HA candles would signify that a strong move higher is underway. The more consecutive candles we have of a single color, the stronger the trend. An exit strategy might be to wait for a doji (wick and tail) or to wait for a reversal candle. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Heiken_Ashi_HA_Reversals">Heiken-Ashi (HA) Reversals</h2>
<p>The HA plotting method helps us to identify trend reversals. The midpoint of the previous candle (high – low/2) is combined with the average price of the current candle (high + low + open + close/4) to create the Heikin Ashi candle. Because two candles are used to create the current candle, the values won’t match those of a normal candlestick. The end result is a plot with nice orderly red and green candles that make it easy to visually confirm trends and reversals. The concept is fairly straight forward and I thank Dave Wyse for introducing this method to all of us. A flat top red candle is a sign of strong downward price movement and a flat bottom green candle is a sign of buying. For a bullish reversal, we will be looking for a flat red top candle followed by a flat green bottom candle. There can be candles between the two of them with wicks and tails or there may not be any candles between the flat top red and the flat bottom green candle. In the chart below, you can see the reversals. This method can produce reversals where you are stopped out and then you immediately re-enter the trade. It does a good job of staying on the right side of the trend. It is sensitive to price movement, but not as sensitive as a normal candlestick. Once the trend is underway, the candles of a single color start to stack and that gives traders the confidence to stick with the trade. This HA reversal variable should be used with other indicators. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="High_Relative_Volume_RRV_">High Relative Volume (RRV)</h2>
<p>Real relative volume (RRV) measures the current volume relative to its 20-period average volume. Notice that I did not say 20-day average volume. If we were measuring the D1 volume, this would be correct. However, we can select any time frame we want in Custom Search. If we select M5 heavy volume, it will look at the most recent M5 bar. We calculate the 20-day average volume for that exact 5 minute interval for each trading day. This allows us to compare “apples with apples.” The average volume for the first 5 minutes of trading is going to be much higher than a 5 minute interval in the middle of the day. The ability to conduct these searches paves the way for the explosion alerts and we will discuss those in another article. A stock will typically have greater volume when the market has greater volume. so we adjust for that to get a true representation of the increase. This is another modification suggested by Vincent Bruzzese and we have adopted that method. </p>
<p>Why is RRV so important? Volume legitimizes price movement. Heavy volume is generated by large institutional traders and it validates the move. Remember, our goal is to follow the “smart money.” If there is no volume, they are not active and we can’t trust the move. If we are day trading during a dull low volume market day, we need to find stocks that have heavy volume. We can use the Heavy Volume Today variable in the lower section of the table (adjustable parameters) and we will discuss that in another article. We can also search for stocks that have had heavy intraday volume. We can use H1, M30, M15 or M5 time frames for this and you should consider including this variable in all of your short-term searches. If the market is not providing any tailwind, the stock will have to do all of the heavy lifting. Only stocks that have RRV that is above average will have the power to make sustained moves. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="In_Compression">In Compression </h2>
<p>This variable appears at the bottom of the upper section because it is not bullish or bearish, the stock is in a compression. We talked about the power of compressions in the Market section. When the stock is trapped in a range buyers and sellers are in agreement and the stock is in equilibrium. The volatility collapses and traders wait for any material news that might change the outlook for the company. Until the stock is above the high end of the compression range or below the low end of the compression range, there is no need to trade it. We are directional traders and we want movement. </p>
<p>Why is this variable important? There are a few reasons to search for stocks that are in a compression. If the market has been selling off hard on a D1 basis, a compression tells us that the stock has relative strength. It is not selling off with the market. At very least, it means that the stock has big buyers who are scooping up shares while the market is selling off. It could be a great candidate for a bullish put spread. We can also search for compressions and then place a horizontal alert above the high from the compression and another below the low of the compression. When there is a breakout, we will know that a sustained directional move could be starting. As with any breakout, we want it to happen on heavy volume and a long candle. This variable is neither bullish or bearish.</p>
