<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Why_is_There_no_Trendline_for_This_Stock_">Why is There no Trendline for This Stock?</h2>
<p>The stock below looks like there should be a trendline and a valid breach. First of all, this system will not catch all of the lines you can draw manually because of the rule base. However, I can tell you with confidence, it will catch a hell of a lot of trendlines you missed. With that in mind, this trendline was not on Now view because the trendline is &gt; 45 degrees. What it looks like on your platform is a function of the number of candles displayed, the spacing between the candles and the X and Y axis. Let me provide two display examples of the same chart below. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>The trendline angle is a function of display, not of calculation methods we use. It also explains why some of the very long-term semi-log trendlines might “appear” to pass through bodies. They do not using our methods.&nbsp;The intercept of that trendline is valid.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Did_we_Catch_the_Trendline_for_the_Chart_">Did we Catch the Trendline for the Chart?</h2>
<p>That is the most important part of the question. Yes, in two manners. First of all, we are aware of all trendlines. We have a ton of analysis that we will be doing on them in the future and you will be able to search by trendline angle if that interests you. This was a steep angle and the system knew of the breach. Notice that we are measuring both sides (High+ and Low+). I go overboard on this stuff. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>Consistent with not trading trendline breaches that are &gt; 45 degrees, this is how we are most likely to pick it up and trade it. There was a High+ Top that happened 11 days ago. You would see this using the Bullish Reversal search and it would appear in that search if it happened 10 days or less ago. I have to limit that threshold at some point to reduce candidates. It is easy enough to expand, but typically, we want these fails to happen pretty quickly. We can experiment with it and adjust that if needed.&nbsp;NVDA missed that cut off by 1 day so it was not in the search this day.</p>

<p>When I grant you access to this view, I run the risk of discrediting these trendlines because you will see something like the next chart. I spent a lot of time trying to eliminate lines that were drawn during a compression, but when I started adding rule bases to do that (and I experimented heavily), many of the REALLY good trendline breaches fell out. That lead to another conclusion that I will cover in a moment. Embrace the Past view. Look at the breaches when there is heavy momentum and gauge the value of trading around these breaches. Study what happens when a stock reaches a “busy intersection” with lots of trendlines. Those breakouts will be significant, but so are the reversals. There is a tremendous learning opportunity that you will not get anywhere else. I’ve learned more about trendlines since I launched this feature than I have in years. You can draw a few trendlines here and there, but you will never get a macro view like this. Hundreds of lines drawn for thousands of stocks. Start flipping and learning. So let’s get back on track and talk about these “dead spots” where lines are of low quality appear. How will we address this issue?</p>

<p>Is relative strength good to trade? Of course. Can we apply it to every instance and make money? No. Then what is the determining factor? When is RS good and when should we avoid it? We do not use RS or any other indicator as our sole basis for entering a trade. We use other factors to filter out the best candidates. Heavy volume, technical breakouts… When we combine all of those other search variables with RS, we find fantastic candidates.&nbsp;The same concept applies to trendlines.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Are_These_Trendlines_Algo_Lines_">Are These Trendlines Algo Lines?</h2>
<p>Not all of our trendlines are Algo Lines, but they include almost all Algo Lines. The same concept we discussed with relative strength (RS) is true of trendlines. Instead of altering rules to filter out trendlines that are drawn during a compression, we draw them anyway and we preserve really good trendlines that will generate great signals for other stocks. Then based on our searches, we will filter out Compression In or we will use other variables that tell us the stock is in a strong trend. Not all of these trendlines are Algos, but I believe all of the Algos are here. We just have to find the best stocks, and then the trendlines will be valid and you will see the Algos. I believe this is also how institutions trade based on these trendlines.</p>
