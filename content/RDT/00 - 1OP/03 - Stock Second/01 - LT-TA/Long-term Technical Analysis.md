<p>You’ve learned how to form a market forecast and how it drives all of our decision making. It determines our trade duration and how aggressive/passive we will be with our position sizing. Instead of trading the S&amp;P 500, we are going to find the strongest component of that index and we are going to “ride the fastest horse”. In this section, we will identify the stock characteristics and patterns you should be looking for. </p>

<p>If you are going to pick the fastest horse in a race, you are likely to look at what it has done recently. Stock charts provide us with that information. We start with a longer time frame and then we look at recent performance. Trendline breaches, price patterns, relative strength, volume and a variety of technical indicators help us to gauge strength. We call these “checkboxes”. The more of them we have marked, the higher our odds of success. We might not always have a great read on the market, but we can always find a strong stock. There are thousands to choose from and we never compromise. In this section we will teach you what to look for in a stock. </p>
