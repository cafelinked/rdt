<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Every stock has it’s own personality and we like some better than others. Here are some general qualities you should look for before you dive deep into technical analysis. This process takes seconds and the skill is developed over time.</h4>
<p>All of our stock analysis starts with a longer-term view of the stock. Before we get into technical analysis, there are qualities that we would like to see in the stock. Each symbol has its own personality so we don’t treat every breakout with the same level of conviction. Most of these qualities are easy to spot on a longer-term chart. In time, you will be able to recognize them in seconds. The goal is to find stocks where we can predict price movement. Here are some of the qualities you should look for.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Orderly">Orderly</h2>
<p>We want to see many candles of a single color grouped together and minor retracement. In the case of a stock that is moving higher, we want tiny dips (if any) when the market drops. That tells us that buyers are aggressive. Any market related selling or profit taking is instantly gobbled up and the declines never gain traction. These nice tight patterns are conveying this. We do not want large mixed candles or long tails/wicks. These are a sign of volatility and uncertainty. We also don’t want overnight gaps in opposite directions. &nbsp;Here is an exercise you should perform for each trade to determine if the price action is orderly. If you don’t feel that you can predict the next move… keep looking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Trending">Trending</h2>
<p>We want stocks that trend well. We do not want stocks that are choppy and that are trapped in a horizontal trading range. &nbsp;Once the trend starts, we want to see historical evidence that it is likely to continue. The stock has a pattern of nice ebbs and flows. It is likely to continue the trend and we can predict where the stock is likely to go. Stocks can change their character over time, but that transition is gradual. Stocks that were in a compression breakout and they start to trend nicely. Perhaps there was material news that impacted the company and now institutions are interested. This price movement could also be attributed to sector rotation and groups can get “hot” or “cold.” Stocks that have been trending well in both directions can also settle down into a horizontal range. When you flip stock charts for a few years, this visual pattern recognition will happen in seconds and it will become automatic. You will instantly separate out the stocks that deserve a close look from those that should be avoided. In the charts below you can see a stock that is trending nicely and another that is choppy and trapped in a horizontal range.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Big_Volume">Big Volume</h2>
<p>When the volume is heavier than normal we know that institutions are trading the stock. That volume confirms that the current move is likely to continue when we see candles of a single color and a nice trend. In the chart above you can see how the stock on the left has nice volume off of support. We also see “stacked” consecutive green candles on heavy volume. You will also notice that the most recent price action for the stock on the left features mixed overlapping candles with wicks and tails on light volume. That tells us that the trend is starting to weaken and that we need to be careful. The chart on the right has periods of heavy volume, but it is all over the board within the range. Volume alone is not enough, we need to have a trend.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Monster_Moves">Monster Moves</h2>
<p>For some reason the old adage “buy low and sell high” is translated by novice traders to mean “buy stocks that are tanking.” Big steep drops are a sign that the stock is in trouble. Institutions are hitting every bid (selling) and the stock is also being shorted. Material news has been released and it will impact future earnings. These stocks will have short covering bounces along the way. Bearish speculators will take gains and that will put upward pressure on the price. When they cover, bullish speculators will jump in thinking this is the “bottom” and they are getting a great “bargain.” Don’t be a “bottom picker” when you see stacked red candles on heavy volume. These stocks need to form a base over many months and the tiny bounces are often bear flags that lead to the next leg lower. You should be more inclined to short these wimpy bounces than you are to buy them. The same concept is true for parabolic rallies on “stacked” green candles with heavy volume. When you see these types of moves on a chart you should be more inclined to join those moves than to fade them. The “big money” is fueling that move and our goal is to follow them. Alternatively, if you see these types of moves and they make you uncomfortable, keep flipping. There are thousands of stocks and you are bound to find some that you like.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Room_to_Move">Room to Move</h2>
<p>We have to be careful trading stocks at the extremes of the range. The temptation is to always expect breakouts, but typically those extremes will be tough to break through. In the case of a breakout to a new high, we need to do that quickly and on very heavy volume. The stock needs “escape velocity” from that resistance and we need to know that institutions are still buying it aggressively. That follow through is critically important and we do not see it that often. The issue with breakouts is that we do not know how strong that follow through is going to be or how far the stock might run. If we buy these breakouts we are constantly monitoring the price action and gauging strength. For this reason, trading breakouts and breakdowns in the middle of the stock’s long term range are more predictable. We have previous price levels that we can use to determine how much “room” the stock has until it reaches its next support/resistance level. Because the stock has already “been there,” it is plausible that it can get to that price point again. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Exhaustion">Exhaustion</h2>
<p>When you are flipping charts and you notice that a stock has rallied to horizontal resistance it is important to look for the starting point. How far did the stock have to travel to reach that level? Stocks that have made big moves will run out of steam at those extremes. There will be instances where they blow through that resistance level with long green candles on heavy volume, but that is not typical. After a big move it is normal for the stock to spend time at that level because there will be some profit taking. If the stock is able to stay fairly tight to that resistance level it is a sign that the recent gains are being digested. Buyers are still supporting the stock and the bid is strengthening. Buyers are hoping to enter at a lower price, but the stock does not retrace very much. In time, buyers will get more aggressive and the stock will move through that resistance level. In the chart below you can see how AAPL traveled a long way from the low and it rested at horizontal resistance. When you are flipping charts you would recognize that exhaustion is likely and that it will take time for the stock to gather enough strength to get through that price point. Set alerts at the high and wait for the next breakout. AAPL paused for a month, buyers got more aggressive and the stock was no longer over-extended. This breakout had a chance to “go.” The same concept applies to shorts. If the stock had to travel a long distance to get to support, it is likely to spend some time near that level. The bounces will be brief and shallow and the stock will stay tight to that support. In time, sellers will get more aggressive and the stock will break that support. It is critically important that these breaches have follow through on good volume. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="News_Earnings">News/Earnings</h2>
<p>Big news events will cause a big gap in the stock price on heavy volume. On our charts, earnings releases are noted with a “B” if the release was before the open and an “A” if the release was after the close. These announcements will often result in a gap up or a gap down. The bigger the gap, the bigger the shock. If the news resulted in a breakout through trendlines, horizontal support/resistance or major moving averages, the move is likely to continue in that direction. Investors were not expecting this news. They quickly adjust forecasts and they trade based on how future earnings will be impacted. In general, you want to follow moves on heavy volume that produce long-term technical breaches. These tend to have sustained directional movement. You want to look for situations where the stock has “room” to the next support/resistance level. In the chart below the stock had a big gap down on earnings. In the first instance, the gap down did have follow through, but the bullish hammer was a warning sign to take gains. In the second instance, the stock did not bounce and the selling pressure remained heavy. Earnings announcements are important snapshots on the company’s fundamental performance during the last quarter. This information will have a lingering effect on the price of the stock for many weeks and we generally want to trade in the direction of these “oversized” moves. If the stock did not have much of an earnings reaction (no giant gaps or breaches) or if the initial reaction was instantly reversed, the earnings will not play as big of a role in the future price action of the stock.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Sector_Rotation">Sector Rotation</h2>
<p>Often Asset Managers will sell stocks in one sector and use the proceeds to buy stocks in another sector. We refer to this as rotation. You do not have to know the company intimately, but you should know the basics of what they do and which sectors and groups they belong to. When you are flipping charts you will often see many symbols that belong to a sector (energy, financials, healthcare…). The rotation could even be related to the international market where they are listed like China. If you see a big move in a stock, read the stock description and get a basic understanding of the business they are in. Also note the group or sector they belong to. Some sectors will lay dormant for long periods of time with little to no action. All of a sudden, they will spring to life. This was the case with SCHW. It is normally a boring financial stock that makes small moves. Recently it took a nose dive along with other financial stocks when a major US regional bank failed. This should have prompted you to investigate.</p>

                    </div>
                
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Volatility">Volatility</h2>
<p>Every company is different and we covered this in the fundamentals section. The consistency of profits and revenues is typically reflected in the price movement of the stock. Start-ups have incredible potential, but they are relatively risky. They might be vulnerable to competition, they might have a high cash burn rate or the product might still be in its infancy. These stocks can make huge swings and you will notice long mixed candles in the chart. When you structure a trade, you have to expect big moves that could work for you or against you. A large flour producer that has been around for decades has a very boring product line, but the profits are consistent. It does not have the upside potential that the start-up has and the price action will reflect that. These stocks do not make big moves. The 20-day average true range (ATR) measures how far you can expect the stock to move in a given day. When you are trading volatile stocks that move 4% or more in a day, they are very news sensitive and they are more sensitive to market moves. If you see stacked green candles on heavy volume, this could be a major development for the company. It could even prompt you to “buy stupid.” A biotech that just had positive clinical trial results could run far because this drug could have a gigantic impact on earnings if it gets FDA approval. It will be difficult for analysts to gauge the potential and the models will differ. That gives this stock room to run. If you see a couple of stacked green candles in General Mills (GIS) on good volume, you should question the move since it is out of character (the stock does not make big moves) and you should find the headline. The point I am trying to make is to know the personality of the stock. Some stocks move like the wind and you factor that into your trading. Some stocks are very consistent and they do not move much so you treat them differently. One stock might be fine to chase and the other you would not.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Penny_Stocks">Penny Stocks</h2>
<p>Avoid stocks that trade under $5. They do not have institutional interest and the price movement is often manipulated by market makers. Remember, we want to follow the “smart money” and they are not trading these stocks. The same is true of stocks that trade less than 1 million shares per day on average. Institutions are not going to be active because they can’t get enough size off to make it worthwhile. These light volume stocks also tend to have very choppy and unpredictable price action. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mega_Cap_Stocks">Mega Cap Stocks</h2>
<p>The top 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are the biggest companies in the world. AAPL, GOOG, META, AMZN, NVDA and MSFT account for more than one fifth of the index. These are giant battleships. The stock bid/ask is tight and the options markets are often pennies wide. These stocks can trend nicely, but it is rare for them to make massive, sustained moves in a short period of time. They are scrutinized by every analyst on “The Street” and it is rare for them to surprise investors. When these stocks breakout, don’t worry that you will never have another chance to buy them. Large institutions are in and out of these stocks regularly (buy and sell programs) and you will be able to buy dips. By the same token, if one of these giants goes on a tear, be ready to take gains on longs. You will have an opportunity to re-enter on a dip. Mega cap stocks are referred to as being “thick.” That means there are always large buyers and sellers. These companies are well-established and there is nothing in their business model that will change dramatically. In the chart below, AAPL had a bull flag breakout D1. Some traders will hyperventilate and chase it higher, but not you. You recognize that this is a mega cap stock and that the volume is fairly light. You will have plenty of chances to buy dips, take gains and reload. </p>

<p>The point of this article was to point out general characteristics that you should look for in a stock. Before a trendline is drawn or technical indicator is considered, we are getting a feel for the stock. Does it trend well? Is the price action fairly dependable? Has it made a huge run recently? Is it volatile or stable? Has it had any massive moves recently? This skill is not particularly hard to develop once you know what to look for. Use this as your guide. The more charts you flip, the better you will get at identifying these characteristics. In time, this evaluation will become automatic and you won’t even realize you are doing it.</p>
