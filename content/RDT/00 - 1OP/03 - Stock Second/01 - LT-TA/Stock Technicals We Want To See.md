<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A combination of these technical qualities need to be present regardless if you are day trading or swing trading. </h4>
<p>In the previous article, we discussed knowing the longer-term personality of the stock. Provided that the stock has the characteristics we want, we are ready to drill down and take a closer look at the technicals that make the move attractive. The goal is relatively straight forward; we need to find opportunities where the next move is predictable. Consider the list below to be D1 checkboxes. The more of them that are marked, the better your odds. I am going to reference the long side to keep this simple, but the same concepts apply to the short side. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Relative_Strength">Relative Strength</h2>
<p>Relative strength (RS) is the edge we trade so it needs to be at the top of the list. Relative strength tells us that institutions are active and our goal is to follow the “smart money.” In my experience, there is no better indicator for predicting future price movement. We need relative strength on a longer-term D1 basis. It is even better if we have it across multiple time frames (M5-D1). When the market has been in a two week decline and the stock is moving higher during that period, institutions are accumulating it. They don’t care about the current market dip; they want to own this stock long-term. When the market finds support, this stock will lead the charge higher. If our timing on the market is early and the market continues to drop, stocks with RS will be resilient. Buyers are lined up and this support will provide us with cushion. If we are completely wrong on the market we can exit the stock with little to no damage and we adjust our market thesis. If the market is close to forming support and the stock is holding strong, we can try to weather the storm. We are always trying to limit our downside risk and maximize our upside potential. Following the “smart money” using relative strength allows us to do that. This is our “edge.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Volume">Volume</h2>
<p>Volume is the second most important factor. If there is no volume, the “smart money” is not participating. Regardless of the technical qualities we discuss in this article, they are meaningless without volume.&nbsp;Light volume moves look good on the surface (price candles), but they are easily reversed. On the other hand, if we have relative strength or a breakout on heavy volume, it is legitimate and we can expect follow through. Just because this section of the article is short, do not discount the importance of volume. It is critically important when we are trying to predict future price movement.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Orderly_Trend">Orderly Trend</h2>
<p>We want to trade stocks that trend. Some stocks make sustained directional moves and others do not. Once the move begins, we want to see it continue. Stocks can change their personality and this is easy to spot on a D1 chart. If the stock is trading in the lower quadrant of the 60-day range it is likely to be in a down trend. Before we consider buying a beaten down stock, at very minimum it has to breach a High- trendline. At that low level, we should expect that the stock is more likely to continue that down trend than it is to bounce. Once the stock makes a higher low double bottom, it breaks through a High- trendline and it has been able to rally above a major moving average we can consider that the down trend is reversing and that an up trend might be starting. A stock that is consistently making higher lows and higher highs is in an up trend and that makes it easier to predict where it is going. Trends that are in the middle of the range are fairly reliable to trade. There is still plenty of upside until it hits the upper end of the range. Some traders will not buy a breakout to a new all-time high. It’s true that you have to tread cautiously when you buy these breakouts, but these can be very lucrative trades. The key is a long green candle closing on its high on heavy volume through that resistance level. Then, we want to see follow through. We discussed breakouts to new highs in the previous article. Remember that we do not want to buy these breakouts if the stock had to travel a great distance to get to resistance and we need to be careful if there are multiple trendlines near the high. We do not want to poke at resistance, we want to destroy it.</p>

<p>A strong trend is important, but we do not want to chase run-away stocks that have gone parabolic. We can day trade those stocks, but we do not want to be the last person standing when the music stops. When the stock rallies well above its EMA 8, you should avoid buying it. You need to wait for a pullback. The stock has run hard and support will be much lower. That means it could retrace a good distance before it finds support and a wide stop will not protect you because there is too much downside. If this move higher has come on heavy volume, then it has a strong “flag pole”. Pullbacks to the EMA 8 will typically establish support. When that dip reverses, the short-term down trendline will be broken and a bullish flag will form. That is when you want to enter. Ideally, you want to catch these stocks on the first major breakout.</p>

<p>Gaps up represent a temporary buy imbalance. They are not all created equal and if you are going to trade gaps, you need to know what’s driving the stock. Some gaps could be related to a market gap up. “All ships rise with the tide” and extra caution should be used when the stock is just following the market. Some of these moves hold, but most of them don’t. Make sure that the gap is related to material news that is specific to the company and that changes the outlook for its earnings. A brokerage upgrade would not qualify as material news. The stock will make a temporary move on an upgrade and then it will retrace. New proprietary technology that is gaining industry acceptance and that is patent protected would be an example of the type of news you can get behind. You’ll know the “real deal” when you look at the price action. If the volume is heavy, institutions are scrambling to exit shorts and to get long. A gap up through technical resistance levels will confirm the strength of the move. We want that gap to hold and we want to see follow through buying. Sometimes, the stock will stack green candles on heavy volume. This tends to be the case when the initial gap is relatively small and this gives you time to join the move. </p>

<p>When the gap is large, the stock could simply tread water for a few days. This would be typical for an earnings reaction. The big move sparked profit taking and those sellers are keeping a lid on the stock. This is fine and it is perfectly normal. In time, that selling pressure will subside and buyers who were hoping for a dip will get anxious. The fact that the stock has not retraced tells you that the bid is strong. Buyers will gradually raise their bids and the stock will start the next leg higher. When we see stocks that are gapping, we want the opening of the gap to be preserved. If that opening price is breached, the stock is likely to fill in some of the gap, especially if it fails in the next day or two.</p>

<p>Some gaps up will fail. Here are some patterns to watch for. If the stock made a big move (10%+) just to get to a resistance level in a relatively short period of time (1 month), it has used a lot of energy to get there. It is likely to have sellers who are anxious to take gains, especially on a nice gap higher. When a stock gaps up to a major technical resistance level, you should be very cautious. The selling pressure at that price level will be heavy and the odds are high that the stock will retreat. The exception would be a breakout through that resistance the next day on a long green candle with heavy volume. We need that breakout a day or two after the gap up. Buyers will have to prove that they want to buy the stock or the selling pressure will build with each passing day. Sellers who thought they might fetch a higher price on a breakout become more willing to take gains at that resistance level. When a stock breaks through resistance, we want it to have plenty of room before it gets to the next resistance level. That will provide the stock with smooth sailing. Stocks with poor, choppy price action and no upward momentum are also likely to fill some of the gap. We know that we should avoid trading these stocks. They need to prove that they are ready to breakout and they do so by stacking long consecutive green candles on heavy volume. Until they do that, we avoid them knowing that they are likely to resume the old pattern. </p>

<p>Sector strength is not something you will typically notice on a chart unless you overlay the sector ETF. Institutions often rotate assets between sectors and groups and often that is the source of the stock’s relative strength. It is important to recognize this influence for a few reasons. First, when a sector or group gets “hot,” it is likely to stay that way for at least a few days. Realize that these moves will have “ebbs and flows” as the money flows in or out. There are “pairs” traders who look for highly correlated stocks and they trade the spread between them. They are long one stock in the group and short another. You do not have to chase stocks that are fueled by sector strength. This is much different than a move that is fueled by news for an individual company. Those trends tend to be much more consistent during the day. Fundamental news for that particular sector or group is fueling the move. In some cases the rotation is fast and furious and there is a sense of urgency. A bank failure would send a shock wave through the financial sector and fear would spread quickly that another failure is likely. Higher oil inventories might weigh on the energy sector, but that move might not be dramatic and it typically runs its course in a day. New patent legislation could affect the earnings for pharmaceutical companies. The impact needs to be estimated by institutions and it will vary from one firm to another because of the pipeline and portfolio of drugs. There are many possible laws that can be passed. Some will impact the entire sector, some will impact a specific group and some will weigh heavily on a particular company. Price action is always the key. If you are using a “top down” approach, look for the leader and stacked consecutive candles of a single color on heavy volume. There are a few issues with leaning too heavily on sector or group strength. One is that the lines between sectors and groups are often blurred. There is overlap (the definitions are similar). The second is that companies might straddle different sectors and groups. For instance, is Amazon a tech company or a retailer? Some sectors and groups like energy/oil producers are narrowly defined and the stocks move in tandem. When the sector is commodity based, it is important to realize this. They are going to be highly correlated to the commodity price and less correlated to the SPY. That means that watching the price of oil is more important than watching the price of SPY. Some oil producers hedge future prices and some don’t. That means that some stocks will react more to the price of the commodity than others. Because this is a commodity it also means that long term fundamentals are less likely to make giant sustained moves. Compare this to a company that just released the fastest GPU ever made. This is unique to the company and it might adversely impact other stocks in the group (competitors). The other issue is that many companies are diversified. They do not belong to one sector or group, they belong to many. The final issue is that each of the companies within a group or sector can vary greatly. For instance, not all retailers are created equally. Walmart and Macy’s are both retailers, but their performance and target market is dramatically different. I am often asked if it is best to trade an ETF for a sector instead of a stock. The answer is NO! That line of thinking would suggest that we don’t know how to identify the strongest stock in the sector or group. We want to ride the fastest horse in the race! If you take that ETF line of thinking to the next step, why don’t we just trade the SPY. That is an ETF as well. When we do that, we lose a very important edge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Strong_Technical_Breakouts">Strong Technical Breakouts</h2>
<p>When we are trend following, we can also look for specific candles to gauge the strength of the trend. We are looking for nice stacked green candles and heavy volume. We want minimal retracement back into those candles. Alternatively, consecutive candles of a single color with a nice orderly grind higher will also work well. When the stock breaks out to a new high through a resistance level with a nice long green candle and that candle is followed by a bearish engulfing candle, we need to tread cautiously. That is a sign of a buying climax and a possible reversal at a relative high. That breakout is likely to fail. In the first chart below you can see how the stock has been in a longer term downtrend. It has spent months struggling to recover and the price action into the bullish breakout was choppy. The Key Bar looked great on the surface, but the breakout had very little room to run because of the 200-day MA. This was not a good breakout and it failed the next day. </p>

<p>If the stock breaks out above a major resistance level and then it tests that breakout and a bullish hammer appears, it is a sign that buyers are still anxious to buy that breakout. In the chart below you can see a much better set-up. The stock has been strong relative to the market and the volume is good. It makes a series of higher lows and higher highs. It has a breakout before earnings that could have been day traded, but we do not hold into earnings. After earnings it had another breakout. The stock surged through the 200-day MA and it tested that breakout. Buyers were engaged and then the stock had a long green key bar. The buyers did not hesitate to buy that dip. They liked the news so much that they did not feel they would have another chance to buy the stock at the 200-day MA. This is a nice breakout that you can swing.</p>

<p>Price compressions are another pattern to watch for. Those breakouts tend to produce nice sustained moves once they have “escape velocity.” They need to clear prior horizontal resistance with immediate follow through or they will get sucked back into the range. A gap up through that resistance is desirable because much of the heavy lifting has been done in one bar. Moves through resistance often look good initially, but if you look back, most of the “probes” have failed. It is important to realize that a compression represents equilibrium. Buyers and sellers agree on the price. It is going to take material news to fuel a breakout one way or the other. Compressions are like a coiled spring. Once the breakout happens, there is follow-through and the traders scramble to adjust. In general, long tight compressions tend to produce sustained directional moves. The beauty of trading compression breakouts is that you can catch the move early and it has room to run. It’s “spring” and it has been trapped inside “all winter.” The key is to make sure that the breakout is not a head-fake. You want heavy volume and a long candle that closes well outside of the range. You should expect immediate follow through. If you don’t get that, there is a good chance that the stock will be drawn back into the compression. Double check the news to make sure the move has substance behind it.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Room to Run</h4>
<p>When we consider a breakout through technical resistance, we want to know that it has plenty of room to run. We call this “Blue Sky.” If the next resistance level is 1% away, there will be another roadblock ahead. Remember, the goal is low risk and high reward for any trade. Trendlines, major moving averages &amp; horizontal support and resistance on a D1 chart need to be far away from the current price. For those of you who are NFL fans, you want Barry Sanders with the ball at the 50 yard line with no one in front of him. That is going to result in a touchdown because no one can catch him. On a day trading basis, I won’t even consider a long that is below the prior day high. If it can’t clear that first hurdle, I have no interest in getting long… at all. The buyers don’t even have enough strength to push the stock through a minor resistance level so the upside is limited. In the charts below, you will see stocks that have room to run.</p>
