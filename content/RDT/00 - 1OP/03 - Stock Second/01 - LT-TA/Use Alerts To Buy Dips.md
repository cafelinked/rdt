<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stocks do not go straight up or down and even the strongest ones have pullbacks. Here’s how to use the alert feature in Option Stalker Pro.</h4>
<p>I have been working on a solution that addresses the age old dilemma of… “buy now or wait for a dip.” Here is the issue. When a stock makes a major D1 breakout on heavy volume and it has relative strength, we know institutions are buying it. We add the stock to a watchlist and it continues to grind higher. Everything looks great, so we buy the stock. As soon as we enter the trade, the stock pulls back. Now we are wondering if we should take a loss or add to the position. We know from Hari’s “walk away analysis” that we need to give the trade some breathing room, but we can’t help but wonder why we always seem to enter the trade at the worst possible time.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Why_Set_Alerts_">Why Set Alerts?</h2>
<p>First of all, there is a reason why “walk away analysis” works. Stocks do not go straight up or straight down. If your market analysis is good and your stock selection is good, you need confidence and that comes with experience. Stick with the position and it will come back and start heading in your direction. There are two critical components to price action. The first is a breakout and that movement through a critical price point is what gets the stock on our radar. The second element is follow through. We enter on the breakout, but we need continuation to make money. Often, the stock has exhausted a lot of energy on the breakout and when we enter the trade it is out of gas. The stock loses its momentum and it retraces. Now we are losing money and we start to question our initial analysis. The chart below is Nvidia. It is the strongest performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year and you can see how the stock has a key breakout and lots of dips.</p>

<p>I believe that alerts are the solution. Instead of taking a position in the stock, we can set an alert. It won’t cost you any money to do this. There is no capital commitment, no position, no emotional attachment and you are in complete control. Often conditions change and the alert gives you time to evaluate the trade from the sidelines. The problem is that alert lines and price alerts take time to set.</p>
<p>I’ve spent thousands of hours dropping alert lines and they have been invaluable. Instead of chasing hot stocks, I set an alert below the current price and I wait for the alert line to be triggered. Once it’s been triggered, I set alerts above and below the current price. If the stock keeps moving lower, I set new upside alerts at lower prices. I want to buy this stock, I just want to enter it as best I can. There are times when the stock retraces more than I would like and that tells me that sellers are active and that the upside is limited. In these instances, I am glad I used alert lines instead of chase the stock because I would have a loss. There are other times when the first upside alert I set is triggered. Now I’ve had time to evaluate the stock and the market and I can decide if the trade still looks attractive. This method is effective, but it is extremely time consuming. There has to be an easier way.</p>
<p>Once I have identified a strong stock, the goal is to enter on a dip. Some stocks do not dip and they just keep going. The vast majority of stocks do retrace and I have to be willing to let the handful that don’t go. We can’t catch them all. Good stock searches put the best stocks in front of us, now I just need to find a way to easily place alerts on the stock. I would love to buy a 3/8 EMA cross, RS/RW, VWAP cross, or an LRSI cross, but those indicators are already on buy signals. What if I could set a condition where the indicator had to go from bullish to bearish and then to bullish again? This feature would certainly make it easier to set an alert. What if I could use multiple variables at the same time? If the stock dips below VWAP and then rallies back above it on relative strength and heavy volume, that would be a good entry point. To take this a step further, what if I could set this alert on a stock search that contains the strongest stocks with just a few clicks? Now instead of spending time flipping charts and setting alert lines, I can spend my day managing alerts and buying dips on the strongest stocks.</p>
<p>This is a feature that was released in 2023 for a handful of variables (LRSI, RS/RW and our B/S signals). In the example below, you can see how this would help you to enter a trade. IOT was in our Green Royal Flush search. If you look at all of the RS/RW crosses M5 for the stocks in the list they performed well with a couple of exceptions even though the market closed near its low of the day. Not all of the stocks will work and that is fine. This method helps us avoid those dogs. We want the stock to preserve most of the gains and we don’t want it to spend much (if any) time below VWAP. In the example below, IOT was a stock I highlighted in a video Friday. It had a great D1 and it preserved most of its gains during the day. When the SPY found support (double bottom), the stock regained its relative strength and it shot higher. This was an excellent alert.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Alerts_for_Swing_Trades">Alerts for Swing Trades</h2>
<p>This method also works well for swing trades. For swing trades on strong stock like NVDA, you would set an LRSI alert when the M30 goes &lt; 20 and then &gt; 20. That is a buy signal according to the rule base and I would use a slightly longer time frame like M30 because it is a swing trade. If the alert is not triggered, there is no opportunity to buy a dip – no harm, no foul. If it is triggered, you can evaluate the market and the recent price action in the stock. If everything still looks good, you will have an excellent entry point for a strong stock. I will be adding the alerts to the Portfolio screen so that you can set exit alerts on your positions. One final note, if the market has a light volume “inside day,” you will want to lean on these alerts for your entry because the stock is more likely to pullback. If the market has a gap and go higher, you might want to buy some shares early and then use the alerts to add on dips. I believe these alerts will change the way we trade.</p>
