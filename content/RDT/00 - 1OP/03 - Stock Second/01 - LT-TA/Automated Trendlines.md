<h4 class="wp-block-heading">As of this writing, I don’t know of any other retail platform that offers automated trendlines. </h4>
<p>Automated trendlines are very difficult to draw and they have taken me many years to develop and to perfect. They were one of the first features added to Option Stalker Pro in 2012. Although useful, those lines have been refined and improved many times in the last decade. New concepts on how to draw them have come piecemeal. Some of those ideas were garbage and some of them served as building blocks for what we have now. The solution we are about to release in February 2023 is game changing and some major puzzle pieces have come to me in the last 6 months. I’m never satisfied and I am always looking for ways to improve, but I believe I have a definitive solution and I will tell you why in this article. I will also cover many other important topics. Make sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHIFq-FzgTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch this comprehensive one hour video</a> on our automated trendlines when you have finished reading this article. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why are trendlines important?</strong> </h6>
<p>Trendlines are the oldest and the most widely used form of technical analysis. Anyone with a pencil and a straight edge can draw one. Because they are widely used, they are relevant. There is another advantage to trendlines: When the stock is in a strong trend, these lines will confirm it. When they are breached, they often signal a reversal well before any technical indicators will.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Why are trendlines so hard to draw?</strong></strong></h6>
<p>Trendlines are easy to draw manually. You do not even need a tool and most people can do it visually. All trading platforms have a trendline tool. You connect two endpoints and the line extends. Some trading platforms like Option Stalker Pro will draw that trendline and when it is breached, an alert is generated. Not all trendlines are created equally. Trendlines that are very tight to the current price action will generate many false signals. Every little wiggle and jiggle will trigger a Low+ alert and generate false reversal signals. Then the stock will continue grind higher. The endpoints of a trendline need to have some spacing to give the stock room to move. When we draw these visually, we can account for that and the endpoints are easy to identify. Determining valid endpoints arithmetically is extremely difficult. This was one of the many stumbling blocks I ran into. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>Why do we want to automate trendlines?</strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>For those of you who draw trendlines, you know the answer. It takes a very long time to flip charts, determine endpoints and to connect the lines. It is tedious work. Good traders take the time, lazy traders don’t. There are often multiple trendlines for the same stock that need to be drawn. Every time a trendline is breached, it has to be redrawn and this takes hours to do each day. If the lines appear automatically on the chart they add so much clarity. You won’t always catch where they come into play visually and you will miss many of them (especially longer-term trendlines). I equate this to sight fishing without sunglasses and then putting on some polarized shades. All of a sudden the fish appear. It is the same with the trendlines. Patterns that were hard to see instantly are visible and can easily be incorporated into your game plan. When you flip hundreds of charts a day, you get very proficient at learning how to trade these automated trendline breaches. When you draw them, you might see a couple dozen across many stocks because that is all you have time to draw. When they are automated you see thousands of them because they are on every stock. The final reason (and perhaps the most important one) is that we can search for these breaches. How many times have you looked at a chart and thought, “Dang, that was a nice trendline breach and I missed it.” When you can search for these breaches, they are delivered to you on a silver platter. There are three major advantages to automating trendlines. It saves valuable time, we can see lines that we would not otherwise notice and we can search for breaches. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are some of the basics?</strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p><a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/long-term-technical/trendlines/">We covered this</a> in the first sections of The System so please make sure to read that article before you continue. The longer the trendline, the more relevant, the more touches the better, the steeper, the less reliable. We connect highs and lows and we do not draw through the body of the candle.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How do we know when we have drawn a good trendline?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>This is an easy one. When your trendlines are breached, is there movement on heavy volume? If not, they are not significant price points. Institutions use trendlines to identify critical price points. When they are violated, you will see movement because the institutions are active. I have visually tested these trendlines for months and I know our trendlines are relevant. Some trendline breaches have minor follow through and they reverse. This is not a bad thing if the reversal is strong. It is a sign that that trendline was significant and when it was breached it produced a strong contra move. Remember, trendlines identify support and resistance levels. They are more likely to hold than to be broken. The breakout and then the strong reversal confirms that this was a significant price level. Some trendline breaches will have excellent follow through. This is a legitimate breakout and now that the stock has broken through that level, it will gain momentum. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What is an algo line?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>One of our Feature Traders Dave Wyse describes them as trendlines that are algorithmically drawn by institutional trading programs. Dave is meticulous in how he draws them and he is an incredible trader. If you watch him nail trades, you can’t help but wonder how he does it. If trendlines are part of his success, then we should all use them. I have been on my own trendline journey for many years, but Dave has certainly inspired me to keep pushing. My goal is always to automate processes so that we all have the same research and I’ve taken many of his concepts and incorporated them into these trendlines.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Are our trendlines algo lines?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>Only Dave can answer that. I believe that within all of our lines there are algo lines, but not all of our lines are algo lines. Don’t despair there is good news.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Why do we have so many lines?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>After spending a decade on trendlines, I believe that there are many lines that emanate from many valid endpoints. This notion is confirmed by the price action I witness at the intercepts. When I have tried to “tweak” trendlines to make them better, I lose many of the fantastic ones that generate great signals. One small change has an incredible ripple effect and all of a sudden we start losing many great trendline signals. I also feel that institutions use these additional trendline breaches as confirmation for scaling into positions. Even if they don’t, I certainly will. I also find that having many trendline breaches in the same direction serve as constant reminders that this trend is strong and that this stock trade is worthy of consideration. Because of my findings, I do NOT believe that additional work is required on the design of my trendlines. They are relevant and I can see that in the price action. Instead, the focus needs to be on the back end. We need to filter current breaches using other criteria. In the next few months we will add additional criteria to Custom Search (OneOption’s Scanner) for trendlines. Then, we will be able to specify the type of trendline (High-, High+, Low+ and Low-) and we will be able to select the desired angle of the trendline, the number of days between the end points and the number of concurrent breaches in the same direction that confirm the trend. Those parameters are likely to get each of us closer to the trendlines we prefer to trade, but I don’t believe they will get us to algo lines. The final part of the solution is other Custom Search variables like RS/RW, LRSI, B/S signals, SMI, Compression Out, % 60-day Range and Heavy Volume. When we add those variables to our searches, all of the marginal trendlines will be filtered out and we will have our algo lines. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Are multiple breaches better?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>Not always, but generally yes. There are times when we might only have one significant trendline. When it is breached on heavy volume and a long candle, it will be as good as any. Typically, we have opportunities to connect longer term and shorter term trendlines. In these cases, multiple breaches are better because more traders are seeing those breaches (one of them is bound to be drawn similar to what other traders draw). Traders don’t all draw the lines the same way, so multiple breaches means more people seeing the same thing, which is typically good when it comes to technical analysis. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Why don’t we draw lines for intraday charts?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>If I thought those lines were relevant, I would draw them. I don’t believe that these super short-term trendlines are significant. The first major hurdle is overnight gaps. We have them everyday. That means we have constant M5 trendline breaches left and right and most of them are garbage. For M5 charts using only the data from the open we don’t have enough data early in the day to draw a meaningful trendline. Later in the day we often see false breakouts around these lines and they are used by institutional programs to lure traders in and then they reverse. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How do we trade trendline breaches?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>As we discussed in the <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/long-term-technical/trendlines/">article referenced earlier</a>, we want trendlines attacked. If they are going to be breached and if the next leg of a trend is going to continue, it needs to happen on long candles and heavy volume. If we simply poke at the trendline, there is a good chance it will hold. If we barely break through it, that price level is likely to hold and we could see a trend reversal. Let’s divide the 60-day range and discuss breakouts (bullish High+ and High-) and breakdowns (bearish Low+ and Low-) in the lower, the middle and the upper quadrants.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Bullish Breakouts At the Low End of the Range</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>It’s been my experience that trendline breakouts (High+ and High-) in the in the lower quartile need to be handled with care. They are higher risk and higher reward trades. Ideally, the stock has multiple Low+ and Low- trendlines that were recently breached and that failed (Fakes and Bottoms). This combination is powerful and it suggests a strong rebound. Extra caution is required if the stock has been extremely weak in the last few months. If the stock has been in a long term downtrend, the base needs a long time to form. Do not be a “bottom picker”. Wait for higher low double bottoms over a period of months. If the stock has nice horizontal support and it is not in a long-term downtrend, it is likely to be a good candidate for a reversal. The stock will be below the major moving average, so we want to see it attack those price levels with long green candles. Chances are, the first few trendline breakouts will have room to run before it reaches the major SMAs. Remember that a stock that is in a serious long term downtrend will have short covering bounces that are “traps”. When those bounces fail, the next leg of the sell-off will resume, meaning this bounce is likely a bear flag. Let’s take a quick break to look at an example.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Example 1: Long-term Downtrend</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>The stock below has been in a nasty long-term downtrend. The following analysis will reference the numbered blue shaded areas on the chart. To the left you can see that the stock had a steep sell-off and the Low+ and Low- trendline breaches were attacked with long red candles. Those were excellent shorting opportunities. In <em>Area 1</em> the stock bounced above the most recent Low- trendline. Was this a good reversal to buy? No, but it was a sign to take gains on short positions. After a massive 33% drop, we needed to see more signs of support before buying. In <em>Area 2</em> we had a Low+ breach. Was that a good short? No. The stock had been showing signs of support and we needed to see it blow through the prior low with a long red candle. That Low+ breach turned out to be a fake. Now we have a double bottom higher low. This still would have been a risky entry for a long. In <em>Area 3</em> we can see a triple bottom with higher lows. We also have two High- breaches and a High+ breach. The long green candle closing on its high and above horizontal resistance is what we needed to see. The open from that candle is tested and it holds. Given the severe drop in this stock it is not a solid buy until it gets through the 100-day MA (black line). Even then, that breakout retraces. This is NOT a sign of a strong stock. If buyers were truly engaged, they would act like they will never have a chance to buy this stock at this price again and you would not see retracements like that. Now the stock is in the middle of the range and it has been able to hold gains off of the bounce and it has preserved the 100-day MA. In <em>Area 4</em> we have a longer term High- breakout. Notice the stacked green candles? This is how we want to attack a trendline – right? The stacked “greens” are nice, but we are right at horizontal resistance. We need to blow through that on heavy volume. That would convince me that a longer-term trend reversal is underway. That does not happen and the stock has a High- Fake when that breakout fails. Is this a good short? There is horizontal resistance and a lower high, but it would be too early to get aggressive at this level. Maybe an OTM call credit spread above $320 would work. That will give you some breathing room in case the stock does breakout. Heading into <em>Area 5</em> we can see stacked “reds” that are also Key Bars and the 100-day MA is obliterated. This is where you can get short. We have a Low+ breakdown and two Low- breakdowns heading into area 5. Once the stock reaches <em>Area 5</em> we are testing horizontal support. We can see that some Low- trendlines have been breached and those breakdowns failed. We can also see many longer term trendlines coming into play at the low. This is a sign of strong support. Is this a good area to buy in? No. As I have mentioned before, we have two mixed Key Bars at the low. This is a warning sign of volatility and a big move is pending. The speed of the recent drop tells us that sellers are aggressive. That is a major warning sign. Also notice the “B”. That is an earnings release and the reaction is negative. We have major support and all of the trendlines tell us this. We need more proof that this support is going to hold and we needed to see some stacked consecutive “greens” after earnings and we did not have that. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>We concluded with area 5. in the last chart, so that is where we are going to start this chart and it is labeled area 1. After a brief bounce off of major support, the stock breaches all of those trendlines with stacked “reds” on HUGE volume. This is not a “mamby pamby” jab at support, this is a major breakdown and it is a sign that the next leg lower is about to start. Near that horizontal support you still might expect some “after shocks”. Buyers are still engaged, but passively. Bottom pickers are also active in area 2. When those Low- trendlines fail, bottom pickers puke out their positions and longer term buyers pull bids. Then the bottom falls out and we see consecutive stacked “reds”. The whole way down you can see lower highs and the bounces are shallower and they are shorter in duration. Even before the waterfall, these were signs that sellers were aggressive. If you can’t bring yourself to short stacked consecutive “reds” on massive volume, you need to learn how to (start small) or you need to find another profession. These are golden opportunities. Look for all of these signs leading into those candles. These are the trade set-ups we dream of. You need to catch these early. Since we are shorting at a relative low, yes it is risky. That is why you need all of the other signs I have mentioned. In area 2. you would have some longer term shorts on. When those Low- trendlines failed, you would have the stock on your radar and you would see those stacked reds on volume right away. That is when you can add to the shorts and get more aggressive. We can expect “Solos” along the way. That is short covering and after a move like this, traders will lock in gains. We can take some gains in area 3. but we do not need to take all of the gains until the end of area 3. There we are seeing some signs that support is forming. We have gone through a lot of information, but it is important for you to see the thought process along various points. Let’s continue with some of the generalizations we can make about trading trendline breaches within different parts of the 60-day range.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TSLA2-1024x731.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="5d18cf21-ba1e-43bc-8d73-47baa61d29ec">

                    </div>
                
<p>In general, breakouts in the middle of the range tend to have nice follow through if the trendline is attacked. The stock has had plenty of time to form support and the move off of the low should be nice and steady with very few retracements. These trendline breaches have plenty of room to run because they are in the middle of the range. The stock needs to blow through major SMAs (50,100,200) that come into play with long “greens” on heavy volume and green Key Bars are always welcome. If we have that, the stock has plenty of room and momentum to get to the high end of the 60-day range. This is also true of stocks that are pulling back from the high end of the range. Resistance has been confirmed and we should be seeing nice long red candles and very little retracement. Ideally, we also have a lower high double top. As the stock approaches the major SMAs, it blows through them along with the trendlines. It has plenty of room to fall before it reaches the low end of the trading range.</p>
<p>Bullish trendline breakouts in the upper quartile of the range can also be excellent as long as the move higher has been nice and controlled and if the stock has not traveled far in a short amount of time. We want that breakout with long green candles and heavy volume. Because the stock has a running start at horizontal resistance, it should have the strength to blow through resistance. If the stock rests and compresses at the high end of the range and it has traveled far in a short amount of time, we have to use greater caution. It has spent a lot of energy getting there and multiple High+ and High- trendlines will be hard to penetrate. If the stock pokes through and the breakout instantly fails, we can expect a pullback from the high and a possible reversal. If the stock is in a long term downtrend and it is at the top of the 60-day range, we should expect resistance to hold. We want the stock to poke through resistance and we want to see those breakouts fail. When they fail, this could set up a great shorting opportunity on confirmed technical weakness (long red candles and a double top lower high). So let’s take another break and look at a stock that has been in a longer-term uptrend. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Example 2: Long-term Uptrend</h6>
<p>I intentionally picked this stock because it is moving well, but it is in a choppy uptrend. First of all, we want nice orderly price movement. That action tells us that buyers or sellers are in control and that action explains why the candles are nice and tight. We’ve covered this price action in previous articles. This stock is not bad, but we need to temper our expectations when we trade it. Chances are it is not going to rocket higher, that is not its nature. This is a stable company that has been around a long time. It has not figured out the next gizmo that is going to reverse global warming so we should not expect parabolic rallies.</p>
<p>Let’s start with area 1. that is in the lower quartile. We can see support coming from two Low+ trendlines. They are attacked with a long red Key Bar. This looks promising, but we know from looking at the historical price movements before the start of this chart that it is choppy. “Measure twice, cut once.” Shorts on that move are immediately disheartened when the green candles after the red Key Bar retrace it. This is NOT a sign of relentless selling, this is a sign that buyers are interested. Bullet dodged and we wait. Now we see a Low+ Fake (gosh I hope you know what that means by now). Have you noticed anything else in this chart that is different from the first stock we looked at? We are near the 100-day MA already. Even though we are at the low end of the range, this stock has been relatively strong in the past and we rallied above the SMA. Is this a good buy? We do have a Low+ Fake (bullish) and we are above the 100-day MA and we are getting through a horizontal resistance level. We also have a double bottom low. Given the nature of the stock, I would not go gonzo buying calls, but yes a bullish put spread below the 100-day MA makes sense. In area 2. we have three High- breakouts so the strength is confirmed. This is horizontal resistance near the high end of the range. We want to see stacked “greens” attacking that high on heavy volume, but we do not have that. The candle bodies are tiny and the volume is drying up. We can day trade the breakout, but we need to be cautious swinging it. The red Key Bar at the end of area 2. is a warning sign. We do not want to see those at relative highs and it is a sign of resistance. Would the High- Fakes be a good short? It is too early to tell, this is probably just profit taking vs aggressive selling. We did see three consecutive red candles on good volume, but we know this is a choppy stock and it is above the 100-day MA. What you do NOT see in this chart is the market. When you add that puzzle piece you realize that this pullback is market related. The market is tanking and this stock actually has great relative strength. It is NOT a good short here because there are hundreds of other stocks that are falling below major moving averages and trendlines on stacked “reds”. Those stocks and not this one are good shorts. This stock might actually be one that you want to buy to hedge some of your shorts. Remember earlier I mentioned that the algo lines will reveal themselves when we add filters and other important variables? Relative strength would certainly be the most important one. So the stock finds support and we see a bullish hammer well above the 100-day MA. It recovers quickly and it blows through the high and it breaches a High+ trendline. The volume is good, but it quickly fades. In this instance, the pullback is 100% market related and we know that because all of our analysis starts with the market. We can see the bottom falling out of the market so our focus at this moment is on shorting other stocks. When this stock gets to area 4., the longer term trendlines are congested. This is a major resistance level. At a time when most stocks are below all of the major moving averages, this stock has preserved the 100-day MA. FYI, I did not add an SPY overlay or other moving averages to the chart because it would be too busy for this lesson. You can see in area 4. the stock does get through resistance on good volume. The candles are tiny, but the volume is good. Buyers are not super aggressive because of the market, but this stock is moving higher and we have opportunities to trade it from the long side. On these breakouts, we can get long and take gains (hit and run). We do not want to overstay our welcome. Heading into area 5. We have a strong earnings reaction (“B”) and stacked “greens” that blow through the High+ trendlines on massive volume. We can get a little more aggressive here, but we have to be cautious with longs because we are in a bear market. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>We are going to take a look at one more unique set-up. There are many stocks that are not high tech companies. They include consumer staple stocks, industrials, healthcare (not biotech), telecom and many others. In fact, most stocks would fall into this category. Some are more cyclical than others, but they have steady earnings and “boring” products that consistently make money. They are established and steady. </p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Example 3: Boring Stocks Making Big Moves</h6>
<p>In the chart below, we see MCD. This is a stable international restaurant business that has been around for decades. Why would a stock like this make steep moves? I don’t know and I don’t care. We do need to check the news and make sure that the move is not related to something that changes the long-term macro backdrop for the business. For companies like MCD, I can’t imagine what that might be. Due to the nature of the business, you won’t often see news of this nature and that is what makes this pattern attractive. The stock simply gets overbought and oversold. When we get trendlines that are &gt; 45 degrees, that is our time to watch for reversals. We won’t draw those steep trendlines, but we can gauge what is happening at the extremes of the range by monitoring trendline breaches at the extremes and by watching for Tops and Bottoms. The blue lines were added to show how steep the move was. In area 1. you can see the multiple High- and High+ trendlines at the high end of the range. These are signs of resistance. The breakout had tiny bodied candles and light volume. This is a low quality breakout. Remember, these trendlines are resistance and at a relative high, they are more likely to fail than to breakout. That is especially true for “boring” companies. It is too early to aggressively short the High+ Top, but selling an OTM bearish call spread above the high certainly makes sense. Next we see a long red key bar. That is a sign that sellers are fairly aggressive. In the middle of the range we see two Low+ trendlines and a Low- trendline that are breached along with the 100-day MA on heavy volume. These are nice long red candles and we are in the middle of the range so we have lots of room to run. In area 2. we make a higher low double bottom and that is where you have to take gains. Again, this is a stable company. The drop has been steep and there is no real reason for it. We need to look for reversals off of this relative low. We don’t have any Low- Bottoms that would alert us of an opportunity, but you can see the giant long green Key Bar. This is a sign the stock is going to bounce. Most of these reversals will at least recover half of the move so you can use that metric to plan your trades. In area 3. the stock is back at the top of the range. It has broken through High- and High+ trendlines and there is money to be made there. We know to be fairly cautious with stocks of this nature at relative highs so we take gains and we are watching for signs of resistance to possibly get short. The two stacked red candles off of the high are warning signs and then we have the High+ Top. It is too early to get aggressively short, but selling an OTM call spread above the high would make sense. To the far right we see a Low+ breach on a red candle and the volume is good. We are inside of the old range and this is where we can get a little more aggressive with shorts. One of the added benefits of finding these set-ups is that the option IVs are fairly cheap on established “boring” stocks and the options are liquid. These stocks do not typically make big moves, but this one is right now. </p>

<p>I am going to conclude this topic with one more stock that is setting up right now (2/16/23). You can go back in time and see if it reversed. The company is JNJ. They are a large medical supply company and they are also in the personal healthcare space. This is a stable company and it has gone through some wild swings. You can see that in the chart below and I will be looking for support at this level and for Low+ Fakes. I have set alerts above the open of the long red Key Bar. Until that is breached, I will not consider a trade. When it is breached, I will start by selling some OTM bullish put spreads below horizontal support. Until I see stacked “greens” I will not get more aggressive with it. Also notice that the volume at the low is light. The red candles look “mean”, but without volume they have no punch. The chart has less trendlines than the other charts I have shown you because I am using the Now setting and not the Past setting. Let’s cover that next. </p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is 1OTL Past?</strong></h6>
<p>The Past trendline display setting shows you all of the trendline breaches and intercepts. This is helpful for many reasons. Until I was able to automate trendlines, I thought I knew how significant trendlines were. A person can only draw so many of them and they have to be redrawn all the time. When I flipped charts, I could see my trendlines, but I had no idea that I was missing so many of them. When I was able to quickly flip charts and see hundreds of trendlines, I became aware of patterns that I was not previously aware of. The Past view gave me that clarity. I’m sure that the Past view will be eye opening for you too. That view also confirms that the trendlines are valid. You can see the price action around them and you can gain confidence in them. When we look at the Now view, we might see a current trendline breach and think, “Yeh, that’s a nice breakout, but I wish the system had caught that earlier breakout.” That’s when you switch to the Past view and go, “Wholly @#$%, it did catch it. I just wasn’t paying attention!” Some of you might be intimidated by so many lines, but I am delighted to know that we catch every breakout and breakdown. For day traders, virtually everyone of these breakouts has follow through the day of.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Why do some of the trend lines pass through the candle bodies?</strong></strong></h6>
<p>This is a “no-no” trendline rule violation. It has to do with line display and not line calculation. We are not violating this rule. First of all, make sure that you are viewing charts using the semi-log scale. That will correct most of your issues (especially for short term lines). The other issues will be for very long term trendlines. For everyone to see the exact same lines we would need the same display resolutions, data points and spacing between the bars. The long-term price intercepts are valid so please ignore those candles.</p>
<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>What is 1OTL Now</strong></strong></strong></h6>
<p>The Now display setting will show you any trendline breaches that have occurred in the last 10 days and they will be drawn to the intercept. You will also see any High-, High+, Low+ or Low- trendlines that are within 5 ATRs of the current price and that have not been breached. These are the only ones that are currently relevant and knowing where they come into play will help you plan your trades. They will also keep your chart nice and clean so you can add other studies and moving averages. Here is a chart that looks bullish today. There are more lines than you will usually see using the Now view and there might be times when you do not see any trendlines using the Now setting.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we trade Fakes, Bottoms and Tops</strong>?</h6>
<p>To a degree, I covered that earlier in the first example. In future articles I will have many more examples. When the stock reaches an extreme, it matters how it got there and the long-term stock trend matters. If the stock had to travel a great distance to reach support, did it happen quickly? Were there big gaps and stacked red candles? If yes, we need to be aware of the news causing this level of selling. If the stock is in a long-term downtrend, this support could easily fail and if we see stacked red candles attacking the relative low on heavy volume, a breakdown is likely. If the stock is gradually drifting lower with many stops along the way, it is likely to rest at the low and we should expect those trendlines to hold. We have to wait for those Low+ Fakes and Low- Bottoms. Ideally, there is also a High- breakout as well. With all of these qualities, that is a reversal I would buy. The same is true of stocks that are at the top end of the 60-day trading range. Is the stock in a strong long-term uptrend? Was the drop to the relative low just a pullback in the context of a long-term uptrend? If so, the breakout could be legitimate. Did the stock cover a lot of ground in a short period of time? If it did, it might need time to digest those gains. In time, buyers will get anxious and the stock will coil like a spring and you will get those nice long green candles through the high on heavy volume. For stocks that have relative strength and that are in a longer term uptrend, you do not want to short those High- Fakes and High+ Tops. If the stock is at the top of a 60-day range and it has been in a long term downtrend, those High- and High+ trendlines are a sign of resistance. They are likely to hold (not be breached). If the breakout does not have follow through, watch for failed breakouts. Those will lead to a nice shorting opportunity. Please refer to the first set of charts I posted and you will see that off of the bounce. </p>
<p>Automated trendlines are very complex. That is why you do not see them on any other trading platforms (none that I know of). Even if they are offered, they might not be valid. I can tell you that my earlier attempts to automate them were helpful visually, but I would not trade off of them. They were constantly breached without any follow through and they had to be redrawn. After years of testing, experimenting and refining, we have relevant trendlines that I believe are of institutional quality. You will see lots of movement around these price points and that is what you should expect from decent trendlines. We will have ways to filter these lines and we will find the best ones using Custom Search. I am releasing 5 new bullish and 5 new bearish trendline searches. These trendlines are going to change the way we trade and they will provide you with clarity. </p>
