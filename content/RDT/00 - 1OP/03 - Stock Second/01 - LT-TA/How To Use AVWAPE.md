<h4 class="wp-block-heading">This anchored VWAP starts on the first trading day after an earnings release and it ends on the last trading day before the next earnings announcement. Here is how to use the study. </h4>
<p>There seem to be as many indicators/studies as there are traders and most of them are derived from an older version of an original indicator with some new twist. That means they all essentially measure the same thing. In the case of simple moving averages (SMAs), they work because everyone uses them and they are “self-fulfilling.” Other indicators work because they allow us to easily gauge what is happening with regards price, volume and time. As you mature as a trader, you settle into the indicators and the settings that work for you and it is pretty rare for me to add something new. </p>
<p>A year ago, I read a post by an old colleague of mine <a title="" href="https://alphatrends.net/anchored-vwap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Brian Shannon of AlphaTrends)</a>. He built a systematic trading approach around anchored VWAP and he felt strongly enough about it to write a book. Brian has been trading for as long as I have so that got my attention. I use VWAP on an intraday basis because I know that executing brokers like Citadel guarantee that price when they are executing trades for funds. That price level is relevant and they are motivated as the stock/index moves above and below that price. What I had not contemplated is that very large orders take time to execute. In an effort to reduce market impact they have to spread that order out. The larger the order, the more time they need. That means that an anchored VWAP could have relevance way beyond the current day. The problem is identifying the moments when funds are motivated to buy or sell a stock. <a title="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICW4sR3HOjU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a 1 hour video I recorded on AVWAP</a> that will also help you to understand it.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What_is_AVWAPE_">What is AVWAPE?</h2>
<p>Four times a year, companies provide us with a health report. They post earnings and most of them provide an outlook for the next quarter. This is exactly the type of news that would interest a Fund Manager. Based on that news, they will decide if they want to buy shares or sell them and they would solicit the help of a firm like Citadel to execute the order at a guaranteed VWAP over a period of days or weeks. That makes the AVWAP relevant during those earnings releases and I call it AVWAPE (the “E” is for Earnings).</p>
<p>This concept seemed valid so I started collecting data. As I started to view the data, I could see that the AVWAPE was relevant. What does that mean? When a stock has been above that level and it comes back to it, there is support at that exact level. There is no other visible means of support or resistance (moving averages, trendlines or horizontal) that could be influencing it. That tells me that other traders are aware of this price level and they take action at that price level. If this concept is relatively new, then most retail traders don’t have it on their charts. It is not a psychological level like an SMA. Other traders are involved at these price points and that leads me to believe that institutions are using it. Sometimes, the stock will bounce off of that level and resume an uptrend and sometimes the stock will breakdown below that level and it becomes resistance. I have found that AVWAPE adds a level of clarity.</p>
<p>Proprietary trading firms have rules that they impose on traders. I am not talking about “prop shops” that lure in “wanna be traders.” I am talking about trading desks at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. Traders are gauged on their performance. If they are performing well… no questions asked. If their performance slips, they have to start justifying their actions. “Why did you buy /ES when it was 2 standard deviations above the VWAP?” I don’t know if these firms use AVWAPE, but I thought I would add the 1SD to the study to see if it had any relevance. I believe it does. It could be because a firm like Citadel won’t buy above that level. If they do, their cost would be elevated and they will lose money honoring AVWAPE. They will be very passive buyers at that level. In fact, they might even be net sellers at that level. Citadel has proprietary algorithms. They see everything because they “touch” so many orders and that information allows them to gauge the buying and selling pressure. If they feel that a small sell program can chase traders out of a position they will run it so that they can accumulate closer to the AVWAPE. The 1SD level could be where institutional traders for Goldman or Morgan are restricted. I am not privy to how these algorithms work or to the rule bases that govern institutional traders. I really don’t need that insight. All that matters is that those price levels are relevant. I would encourage you to add AVWAPE to your charts. Go back and look at the last 4 earnings reactions. The chart below is ORCL and you can see how important these levels are. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Does_AVWAPE_Work_for_all_Stocks_">Does AVWAPE Work for all Stocks?</h2>
<p>If the stock has a muted reaction to the earnings announcement, it is less relevant. The stock is trapped in a range and the earnings release might not have provided any new and material information. Chances are the stock will spend time around the AVWAPE and within the 1SD lines. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Is_AVWAPE_Relevant_After_a_Huge_Earnings_Gap_">Is AVWAPE Relevant After a Huge Earnings Gap?</h2>
<p>Yes, but realize that large moves are going to take time to digest. A firm like Citadel will have many orders. On a big gap up, there will be buyers and sellers (profit takers). I’m sure the first thing they will do is to pair those orders off and they will gauge which way the stock wants to go based on that order flow. Sometimes it will take weeks before we get a clear picture of where the stock is headed. If it spends time at the upper 1SD and it can’t breakout, eventually that selling pressure will build and the stock will retest the AVWAPE. If it quickly falls below the AVWAPE on a large red candle and heavy volume, it will be a sign that traders are exiting the longs and often the stock will fall to the lower 1 SD line. On the other hand, if the stock finds support above the AVWAP or if we see a bullish hammer off of the AVWAPE, it is a sign that buyers are interested at that level. We use the same principles we use for other support and resistance levels. This same concept also applies to stocks that are trading at the lower 1SD line. If it can’t be penetrated, it will become support and the stock will rally up to the AVWAPE. If it blows through that level it will test the upper 1SD. If it pokes around the AVWAPE and you see a bearish hammer off of it or below it, resistance is still intact. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Can_you_use_the_AVWAPE_1SD_as_a_Target_">Can you use the AVWAPE 1SD as a Target?</h2>
<p>Yes. I would take partial profits at those levels and then wait and see. If the stock moves through the 1SD with ease, it is likely to continue the move higher. Then you can use the 1SD as a stop.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Can_you_use_AVWAPE_as_a_Stop_">Can you use AVWAPE as a Stop?</h2>
<p>Yes. If you bought a breakout above AVWAPE, you want that level to hold. Ideally, the stock moves quickly through the 1SD. If it spends time at the upper 1SD you can use the AVWAPE as your stop (stock closes below it). If you bought a breakout above the 1SD, you can use the AVWAPE as your stop. Once you are in the trade, you want bounces above the AVWAPE. Buyers need to be aggressive/hungry at that level. As with everything I have taught you to this point, we don’t trade light volume breakouts on choppy stocks. We want that solid D1 chart with relative strength, heavy volume and stacked candles. These elements need to be present with any trade.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What_is_Your_Favorite_AVWAPE_Setup_">What is Your Favorite AVWAPE Setup?</h2>
<p>From a bullish standpoint, I like stocks that don’t have a monster earnings gap up. Those moves take time to digest. Regular earnings reactions test the upper and lower 1SD lines for AVWAPE. I like the ones that shoot through the upper 1SD AVWAPE line. They hold above that level for a few days. That AVWAPE 1SD line becomes support and I like the trade even more when the stock starts to rally away from it. That is a true sign of strength and it tells me that trend is likely to continue.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="If_1SD_is_Resistance_Institutional_Traders_are_not_Inclined_to_Buy_Above_it_who_is_Buying_">If 1SD is Resistance &amp; Institutional Traders are not Inclined to Buy Above it, who is Buying?</h2>
<p>To fuel a move higher, it has to be “big money.” Sure retail traders can have some impact, but it is minor. The move higher has to be a long-term Asset Manager(s). They don’t care that the stock is above the 1SD AVWAPE. They like the long term fundamentals and there has been a material change since the last earnings report. These buyers plan to own the stock for years. </p>
<p>I wrote an article on AVWAPE because I have researched it and because I find it very useful. I have not spent as much time with AVWAPQ or AVWAPM.</p>
<p>Option Stalker Pro is not a “run of the mill” trading platform. It has all of the standard features, but if I add something it has to be relevant. That is why this platform has features that you will not find anywhere else. I understand why AVWAPE is used by institutional traders and based on my observations I can tell that they do use it. Don’t take my word for it. Conduct your due diligence and draw your own conclusions. You had to go through the same process when you learned to trade RS/RW. It made sense, so you investigated it. You also had to go through the same process with 1OP M5 for SPY. In the case of 1OP, you don’t know why it works, only that it does. </p>
<p>I have studied AVWAPQ (quarterly anchors based on triple witching), but not to the extent of AVWAPE. I have found it to be useful for indices and Fund Managers tend to make allocation decisions at the end/beginning of the quarter so this anchor makes sense to me. This is also when indices rebalance. They don’t have earnings and that is why this anchor might be relevant. I have added AVWAPM (monthly anchor to the first trading day of the month) since more and more Asset Managers rebalance on a monthly basis. I still have to observe the significance of this anchor and having a few hundred eyeballs on it will help. Please share your observations. </p>
