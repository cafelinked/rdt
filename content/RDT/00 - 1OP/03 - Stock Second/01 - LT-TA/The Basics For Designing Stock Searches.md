<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Learning how to construct stocks searches requires knowledge and experimentation. Here are some tips to help you get started.</h4>
<p>Let’s start with the obvious. Before you search for stocks, you have to know what you are looking for. In the last 2 articles you learned the stock personalities and the technical characteristics we desire. This knowledge is critically important because we rely heavily on visual confirmation. When you are flipping through the search results you need to recognize the best prospects instantly. When you construct your own searches, your goal is to capture as many of these great looking stocks as possible and to eliminate the worst prospects. You don’t want to miss the best ones or waste time flipping through marginal charts. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cast a wide net and then draw it in.</strong> There is a fine balance between being too open with your searches and too restrictive. If you are too open you will waste time flipping charts and you will get frustrated by the amount of time it takes to find the best prospects. When you are too restrictive with your search variables you will miss some of the best prospects because they did not meet one or two of the criteria. For this reason, it is best to identify a few variables that are the most important to you. I do suggest having relative strength and volume in most of the searches you construct. Run the search and if you have more than 40 results, add the next variable. With each checkbox you mark, more candidates will be eliminated and the quality of the remaining candidates will increase. I find that a list of 15 -20 candidates is optimal. When I reach that stage I swap a variable out for another one to see if new prospects appear. You might consider creating a search that uses a powerful core of variables. Then add variables to create alternative versions.</p>
<p><strong>The market impacts your searches.</strong> In the back of your mind you should know what the market has been doing for the last few weeks and the last few days. Know how will the market action impact the searches you are constructing and running. If the market has been in longer term up trend, but the last 3 days have been soft, your bullish search results will not yield as many candidates. Your “bread and butter” bullish searches that you have constructed might be too restrictive given the current market conditions. That means you have to loosen your search criteria. If the SPY was down huge the day before and it is down again today, a very basic bullish search might do the job. For instance, “Show me a stock that is above the prior day’s high, has great option liquidity and that has better than average volume today.” Why is this a great search? In order for the stock to have a shot at the prior day’s high, it probably did not get badly beaten down during the market sell-off. It had relative strength and it stayed within striking distance of that high. Today the stock is above that high when the market is down (relative strength) and it has good volume. Your other bullish searches might only return a few good prospects, but this search will leave the door open for other strong stocks that might have otherwise been filtered out.</p>

<p><strong>Contra searches can be equally effective.</strong> Once you construct a bullish search that produces great results, you can reverse the binary variables so that you can have a bearish contra version of the search. Normally, both versions will yield a fairly balanced number of candidates. When one search has many results and the contra version has very few results, the message is clear. Favor the side with the most results because the market is trending in that direction. This is also a time to adjust the searches. The side with the least results can be loosened by removing checkboxes and the side with many search results can be tightened by adding variables. In a raging bull market you can be very selective and your bullish searches can have many variables marked. When you are flipping through your bullish searches keep in mind what the market has been doing. If it has been flat for the last three days, look for stocks with nice green candles during that stretch. in an instant you should recognize those as decent prospects. In this scenario, it is going to be tough to find good bearish candidates. That means you need to remove some of those search variables. When you find a great mix of variables the contra searches are very effective because you know what makes that search “tick”. Typically, you will have good prospects on both sides without having to do a lot of adjusting. </p>
<p><strong>The time frames for the variables should match the intended trade duration.</strong> Our edge is trading relative strength. If a stock is strong vs SPY across all time frames, it is likely to be a great candidate. However, realize that the M5 and M15 time frames are short-term. If you are looking for great swing trades, M5 and M15 are not relevant and you are filtering out great prospects. Focus on longer time frames and use other variables with long-term time frames. Know that the shorter time frames are very sensitive and they change from bullish to bearish very quickly. If you are looking for bullish day trades you might only need D1 to be strong vs SPY (to insure some longer-term strength) and the rest of the variables could be short-term (Heavy Volume M15, RS M5, RS M15, &gt; prior high, HA Continuation M5…). A swing search that looks for longer-term swing candidates for bullish put spreads uses longer time frames than a “lotto” search that might only need M5 and M15 time frames because you are looking for a prospect an hour before option expiration.</p>
<p><strong>Take extra time to name and describe your searches.</strong> There will be unique market situations where special searches are useful. For instance, the market gaps up big to a resistance level and there is a chance for a bearish reversal right after the open. You don’t know if the move is going to hold or reverse, but you know that our most profitable scenario is a reversal. Take a peek and see if there are any stocks that are below the prior low on heavy volume. If you get the reversal, those stocks are going to drop like a rock. They have already defied gravity when the market ran higher and that is a sign of heavy selling pressure. Create names for the searches that tell you when to use them and write detailed descriptions of what they look for and mention the variables used. If the searches need to be refined or renamed, use the edit feature. It will reveal all of the search variables that were used in the search.</p>

<p><strong>Always search for bullish and bearish stocks.</strong> Day traders always need to stay one step ahead. If the market has been range bound and a benign cycle is more than half over, you start running searches for the next cycle on the notion that it will produce. This will give you time to watch those stocks while the cycle completes. You can compare the stocks to the SPY during that time on a tick-for-tick basis. If the cycle completes without a market move and there are signs that a trend reversal is likely, you will be ready to start scaling in. You’ve had time to watch the stock and you can see that it is ready to move. This same concept is true for swing traders. We never know what the market is going to throw at us and in a raging bull market you might find some excellent shorts. Consider using these to hedge your primary positions. Seeing both sides of the market is important. It keeps your perspective balanced and it elevates your awareness. </p>

<p><strong>Backward engineer a search.</strong> There will be times when you see a great stock that did not come up on our favorite searches or your searches. It has orderly price action, relative strength, technical breaches, good volume and all of the other characteristics we like. There is one missing component that is keeping it off of our searches. When this happens, start with the most basic variables and check to see if the symbol is in the search results. If it is, keep adding variables until you no longer see it. Try various combinations and see if you can construct a search where it appears with 10-15 other stocks. This process will help you to understand the other variables and you are likely to discover very effective combinations that you had not previously considered.</p>
<p><strong>Our favorite searches are a starting point.</strong> They were never intended to be all inclusive. That is why I developed Custom Search. You have the power to develop searches that fit the patterns you like to trade and that are well-suited for special situations. Your searches will be superior to our searches for that reason. It’s important for you to experiment with Custom Search. The combinations are endless and you will construct a portfolio of searches tailor fit to your style. </p>
<p>In the next section I will go through each of the Custom Search variables so that you understand what they measure and how to use them. It is going to be a very long article. Once you fine tune Custom Search, you will be able to find exactly what you want.</p>
