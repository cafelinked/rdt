<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stocks do not move in straight lines, they move in cycles. Think in these terms and your timing for entries and exits will improve.</h4>
<p>Traders often enter a swing trade and it instantly moves against them. The mindset for most of them is that since it is a swing trade, they have some time so it’s not the end of the world if the position moves against them. In fact, most traders expect that they will have to weather an adverse move. That’s a healthy mindset. You need to be confident in your analysis because it gives you staying power. Unfortunately, there’s a huge difference in how professional traders and novice traders enter a position. </p>
<p>Novice traders tend to be impulsive. They don’t wait for all of the “checkboxes” to be marked and they pick inferior stocks. Let’s assume that they’ve gone through this course and they have an excellent stock on their radar. It has broken through resistance on heavy volume and the technicals are strong. They take a full position and they expect immediate follow through off of that breakout. They are reactive and they have FOMO. Over the next few days (or weeks), the stock flounders around and it does not have follow through. Perhaps the entire breakout candle has reversed. If they bought at the money call options, they’ve expired for a total loss. If they bought stock, doubt creeps in as it pulls back. They gave the position plenty of time and room to move around and they stop out for a substantial loss. When they review their trade logs they can’t figure out what went wrong. Everything looked so good when they took the trade. All breakouts are not the same.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at some of the possible issues. You’ve already completed the Market First section so this should be review for you. The market does NOT go straight up or straight down. It has cycles and it goes through different phases.</p>

<p>Our highest odds for sustained directional strength comes during a trend reversal. During the transition period from one trend to the next, the price action is very choppy and the market is trapped in a horizontal range. Both sides are battling it out and there are big swings both ways. Your swing trades during a transition should be minimal and your timing needs to be excellent (buy at the low end of the range, short at the high end of the range). You don’t know the direction and you will eventually get trapped on the wrong side. Ideally, you’ve made a lot of money on the previous trades and they will more than offset the eventual loss. That loss will pave the way for big gains because we are entering the “sweet spot” where you can aggressively take directional trades.</p>
<p>Quick note: Don’t confuse a transition with a compression. Compressions are low volatility events and they are simply pauses in the middle of a trend (price consolidation). </p>
<p>We have to wait for technical confirmation (major technical breaches) and follow through as we exit the transition phase. Once we get to the next stage, there is a “sweet spot” where you can get fairly aggressive with swing trades. It’s good to take swing positions with this backdrop and it is OK to FOMO into a swing trade. If you trade options, make sure to buy options that expire a few months out. We’ll cover options extensively in the last section of the course. You are going to have a very strong market tailwind so there is room for error. In some cases that directional strength can continue for a few weeks (shorter-term trend reversal) and in some cases that directional strength can last for many months (longer-term trend reversal). You have to know which duration you are trading and the price action will tell you how strong the reversal is. Trend reversals don’t happen that often so it is rare to trade with this aggressive mindset. Trend reversals coincide with major economic shifts. Most novices will not wait for technical confirmation for the trend reversal. They will pick market tops and bottoms and they will get “chewed up” during transitions.</p>
<p>This is a fairly important point. Many novice traders will have a “gut feeling” that a market top is forming and they will wait for signs of selling pressure. When the market pulls back they are convinced that it is going to roll over so they short. That dip turns out to be a normal pullback in a bullish trend, the market slingshots to a new high and they take a big loss. That dip was a buying opportunity, not a shorting opportunity. It is critically important to wait for technical confirmation and to wait for that technical breakdown. Know that long-term trends die hard.</p>
<p>The chart below is a transition from a bear market to a bull market in 2022. There is still not technical confirmation of a trend reversal, but notice the higher lows and how the market is able to rise above the major moving averages. The 50-day MA is above the 200-day MA and that is a “Golden Cross”. You could have traded those wide swings at the extremes of the horizontal range, but you did not want to be aggressive and you did not want to over stay your welcome. </p>

<p>When the market is in the “sweet spot”, you will see more trend days. If the market is trending higher and it is just starting a trend reversal, every intraday dip will be a buy and you can almost do it blindly. Here’s what’s happening. Trading institutions also act as executing brokers and they know what Asset Managers (long-term money) are doing because they are handling those orders. The price action will be <strong>orderly and tight</strong> because they don’t run programs to probe for support. They already know it’s there because they have buy orders in hand for their customers (Asset Managers). Sell orders are instantly “gobbled up” so you don’t see any dips.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the trend reversal the momentum is strong. We will see horizontal compressions (pauses). In a bullish trend, the EMA 8 will catch up during the compression and then the next leg higher will begin. As the trend matures there will be dips. The selling pressure is a little heavier because valuations will be stretched and early buyers have big gains that they can lock in. Asset Managers won’t chase breakouts, but they will buy dips. That is exactly what you should be doing! The price action will look more like a trading channel. Institutions will run buy and sell programs to find support and resistance. That results in choppy price action like we see below. This is normal price action and the buy/sell programs are running. </p>

<p>I wanted to spend time on these D1 market phases because stocks go through these same phases. Sometimes the stock moves mirror the market. This is particularly true if the stocks are in the S&amp;P 500 and if business conditions are stable. At other times, they might have their own cycles because business conditions are changing. They key is to sync up the market cycles with the stock cycles. In the chart above the trend is still higher. However, we’ve seen some deep drops. There was not any technical confirmation of a trend reversal so our mindset was to buy dips. Our goal is to find stocks that barely pulled back during that time because it tells us that institutions are accumulating shares. They don’t care that the market dipped for a month, they are long-term buyers. Consequently, the stock has relative strength. If our timing on the swing longs was a little off and the market dip was deeper and it lasted longer than we expected, the stock will hold up well. That’s why we initially take starter positions. When market support has been confirmed and when we see it bouncing, we can add to the stock position if it is leading the charge. We expect the stock to be strong because buyers were aggressive when the market was going down. Now that there is a market tailwind, the stock should surge higher. Here’s an example.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pltr101024-1024x915.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="703847a0-9c12-4d2c-8955-07745db94d9e">

                    </div>
                
<p>This is another example of a stock that changed from one market cycle to another. During the first SPY drop, the stock fell considerably and it tested the low end of it’s trading range. The percentage move was small relative to the SPY which dropped 10% in a short period of time so it did have slight relative strength. When the market dropped for the second time you can see that the stock held strong. It was right at the high end of the range and AVWAPE was preserved. As soon as the market regained its footing, the stock shot higher and it has a long green bar to a new all-time high on heavy volume. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXMqr-z11XE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to watch my analysis of the stock on YouTube.</p>

<p>This all sounds so easy right? Wait for the market to dip and once support is confirmed, buy stocks that have relative strength. In the context of timing we know that the market moves in cycles and so does the stock. Our goal as swing traders is to wait for everything to line up. In the chart below you can see the light blue rectangular boxes. During those moments, the cycles for all of the variables are moving in the same direction. One of the lines could be the SPY D1, one of the lines could be the stock D1 and another line could be the stock’s relative strength D1. We enter at the beginning of the box and we exit at the end of the box. That is the “sweet spot” and that is where our odds are the highest. Throughout the course you will also hear me reference that the “tumblers are all lined up” and the lock opens. In hindsight the stock set-ups I highlighted were just that easy. </p>

<p>One of the problems with the technical analysis books I’ve read is that they find “picture perfect” examples. They make you feel like these set ups are so obvious. Here are some of the issues with the image above. 1. The cycles (for the stock and the market) are not uniform like they are above. The width and height varies so the turns are harder to predict. 2. Sometimes the cycles have no trend (horizontal) and sometimes they have a choppy trend (trading channel). 3. Most of the time, the cycles are not in sync. If you look at the image above, 80% of the time you are waiting for them to align. Most traders don’t have the patience to wait for the “sweet spots” and they blow their capital when conditions are marginal and the odds of success are low. </p>
<p>So let’s get real. What I’m about to share can be verified on my YouTube channel. I post videos each week and they go all the way back to the 2008 financial crisis. I’m not going to go through why I was bullish or cautious or bearish because you can watch that actual analysis in the YouTube videos from 2024. This is how I felt during each of these periods and what I was thinking.</p>

<p>In the chart above I am trying to gauge the cycles we are in so that I can correctly position my trades. The green shaded areas are where my confidence was high and I was bullish and the red shaded area is where my confidence was high and I was bearish. </p>
<p>Our market confidence is not always high and you can see lots of unshaded areas where my confidence was low. From November 2023 – March 2024, my confidence was very high and the entire chart over that time would have been shaded green. The dips were brief and shallow signaling a strong trend (cycle).</p>
<p>At the end of the green shaded areas in the chart above, the price action was telling us that a pullback was coming. The price action was choppy and the volume was light. The first dip on the chart above was more pronounced (depth and duration) than prior dips and that was a sign that the next dip might be more substantial. In the second green shaded area above we waited for signs of support. The market made a higher low above the 100-day MA so we entered starter longs. When the market rallied through the 50-day MA we added to longs. We rode that move and we took gains when the last leg higher came on light volume. We don’t pick market tops so we don’t short. This is simply a time to reduce swing risk. Cash is a position. If we get the pullback we are expecting, we’ll be glad we reduced risk. We will avoid losses and we will evaluate the pullback. If the pullback is brief, shallow and unorganized, the dip will present a buying opportunity. If the duration is long and the drop is deep, it is a sign of a possible trend reversal. Then we would expect the bounce after that drop to be short in height and not to last more than a couple of weeks. That would be a sign that a more significant down cycle was coming. </p>
<p>We are constantly evaluating the current cycle and we are looking for signs that it might be ending. We reduce risk along the way when we see warning signs. The goal is to take a nice fat chunk out of the middle of the move. We are not predicting that a new cycle is starting, we wait for confirmation (technical breaches). The character of the previous cycle helps us visualize what the next cycle should look like. If the previous cycle lasted a long time and it covered a lot of territory, we would expect the contra cycle to be brief and shallow. In a strong up trend, we watch for support at nearby technical levels and we expect to see it. When the market bounce proves to be brief and shallow, we have confirmation that the trend is still intact and we reload. Eventually, there will be a contra cycle that is much deeper than we expected and it will last longer than we expected. Since our exposure is reduced, we are not worried about losses, we are in evaluation mode. A deep and long lasting contra cycle tells us that a trend reversal could be coming.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>So let’s return to the chart above. We had a deeper dip (far left side of the chart above) than we had seen previously and that was a potential warning sign. The market pulled back, we waited for support and once we had confirmation, we bought stocks where the D1 was strong and where the stock had relative strength. So the market cycle was aligned with the stock cycles. The rally from the April low was substantial and it lasted 3 months. However, the dip in April was deeper than we had seen to this point and that was a sign that I might try some shorts if I saw a technical breakdown. In the pink shaded area, I had good entries on starter swing shorts positions, but bull markets die hard. I knew that the market would bounce and the nature of that bounce (height and duration) would tell me if sellers were in control. I took starter shorts because they were weak and they had downward pressure regardless of the market. After a 10% drop in 3 weeks, the odds were high that I would have to weather a bounce and that is why they were only starter positions. The market bounced much higher and longer than I expected so I had to temper my bearish bias. On the next dip I exited my starter swing shorts for small losses because buyers had demonstrated more conviction than I thought they would. When the market quickly recovered from that second dip I did not hesitate to shift my bias to being more bullish.</p>
<p>I could go through dozens of bullish picks in my videos during the green shaded areas on the chart, but I think it will be more fruitful to look at the pink shaded area since the market dropped, but we did not get the trend reversal that I suspected might be setting up. I was getting more bearish in July so I was looking for stocks that were already showing signs of weakness. Their down cycle had already started. We don’t pick “tops” so we needed technical market weakness. If we got that, these were the stocks to short. Then the D1 stock cycle and the D1 market cycle would be aligned. These are not some of the picks, they are all of the video picks from the middle of July to the first week in August. CAVA, ASML, META, SHOP (7/17/24), ULTA (7/21/24), COST (7/28/24), MRK (7/31/24) and DELL (8/4/24). In the middle of August, I took a couple of weeks off and I described the price action that would keep me bearish. </p>

<p>As you look at the charts above you can see how the entry points were good. The stocks were showing signs of weakness before the market rolled over and as soon as the market dropped these stocks tanked. The bearish market cycle lined up with the bearish cycle for the stocks. COST and MRK got the market tailwind they needed, but they did not drop very far so you needed to take small gains when they gained relative strength. The very last pick was a short for DELL and I was leaving for a couple of weeks. I was very certain that after a 10% market drop in 3 weeks, we were going to get a market bounce and I explained this. I didn’t know what that market cycle would look like, but I knew that it had to be brief and unorganized to preserve my bearish market bias. The SPY needed to stage a weak bounce with mixed overlapping candles and it needed to hit stiff resistance at the 50-day MA. If that happened, DELL needed to bounce and hit resistance below the 200-day MA. If both of these events occurred, the two cycles would be in alignment again and DELL would be a good short. As it turned out, the SPY blew through the 50-day MA and DELL rallied above the 200-day MA. No trade.</p>
<p>When I returned from my vacation two weeks later, the market rallied and it was within striking distance of the all-time high. That was a sign that buyers were much more aggressive than I had expected and sellers were much less aggressive than I had expected. It was time to adjust my market bias to neutral. The next drop featured a long red candle that stopped just short of the 100-day MA. Only immediate follow through selling that breached the 100-day MA with ease would get me to shift from my neutral market bias. I had already seen more strength in the prior market bounce than I had expected. The market instantly recaptured that long red candle and it closed above the 50-day MA. That’s when I knew that buyers had the upper hand and that a bullish market cycle was starting. It was time to buy. </p>
<p>As I write this it is 10/10/24 and we have been focused on the long side so let me give you a couple of stocks that are syncing up. DDOG was featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNBfKbPWZpA&amp;t=876s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/6/24</a> video and SNOW was highlighted in the<a href="https://wwwyoutube.com/watch?v=daPdmL_GwLQ&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/daPdmL_GwLQ?si=jfbvQPkl-EpO_msQ&amp;t=2004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/9/24</a> live event.

<p>I’ve been focusing on market analysis, but the same patterns can be seen in individual stocks. The nature of the current cycle sets the expectations for the next contra cycle. If the current cycle lasts long and it is tall, we expect the next contra cycle to be brief and shallow. We are always watching for signs that the current cycle is exhausted. If the current cycle has lasted a long time and it has produced a substantial move, these warning signs will be more important than they would be for a contra cycle. Why? Because we are looking for signs that it might be time to take gains. We are also expecting the contra cycle to be brief and shallow. When the shorter-term contra cycle is ending, it could come very quickly. For instance, in a strong long-term bullish up trend, the bearish contra cycle might be nothing more than a dip that lasts a week or less so there is little to no warning when it reverses. When it comes to the longer-term cycles, light volume and mixed overlapping candles are a warning sign. Bearish engulfing candles and bearish hammers off of a relative high are a warning sign. We don’t predict that the trend is going to change and we don’t predict that a new cycle is going to start. We wait for technical confirmation. If the market has been in a strong up trend, we don’t predict that the next bearish cycle is going to be deep. We expect it to be brief and shallow and that it is going to provide us with an excellent buying opportunity. The thought of shorting never enters our mind. We are in cash. We are focused on waiting for support and our plan is to buy the dip. At some point, the brief and shallow dip that we were expecting is going to surprise us. It will be deep and it will last much longer than we expected. We can still trade the next bounce because the longer term trend was so strong, but we have to be more cautious because the drop was deep. We scale into long positions and we only add on confirmation. Our average cost is always below the current price so we have cushion. We pay particular attention to previous resistance levels and we want the stock to blow through them. If the stock struggles to do that we take gains knowing that a more substantial down cycle could be coming and that a trend reversal is possible. </p>
<p>Nvidia is one of the largest stocks so let’s try to apply this concept of cycles for the last few years. </p>

<p>In this article we’ve learned that stocks and the market move in cycles and the same patterns apply to both. We evaluate the previous cycle and it sets our expectations for the current cycle. We build our game plan around those expectations. As the current cycle unfolds, if the price action is consistent with those expectations, we add to our positions when we have technical confirmation. We also know the warning signs to watch for that might signal the end of the cycle and we take gains when we see them. From the time we enter the trade, we also know the price action that is NOT consistent with our expectations. We are prepared to exit for a small gain/loss and we know the price points where we would do so. </p>
<p>If we are on the sidelines after a nice gain, we set our expectations for the next contra cycle. Sometimes it will conform to what we expect and we will have a nice entry point to join the long-term trend. Sometimes the contra cycle will surprise us. If it covers more ground and it lasts longer than we expected, we adjust our bias and we start watching for signs of a possible trend reversal. </p>
<p>When the market is transitioning the cycles are frequent and the swings are big. We need to trim our swing exposure and by staying in the very best stocks so we can weather some of the volatility. When the market breaks out from the transition, we will enter the “sweet spot” and we can expect a nice long cycle. This is where we can get aggressive with our swing trades. As the trend matures, the gains will be marginal and the contra cycles will become more frequent. They will be a little deeper and they will last a little longer. That is when we need to watch for a transition and a possible trend reversal. </p>

<p>We conduct technical analysis to identify market cycles. When the current market cycle is strong and the signs to exit are present, our only thought is to evaluate the contra cycle and to trade in the direction of the current strong cycle. We are not looking to trade those contra cycles because we expect them to be weak and to reverse quickly. We don’t trade against the trend. When the contra cycle surprises us and it is deeper and longer than expected, we adjust our expectations for the next cycle. </p>
<p>The exciting part of this system is finding stocks that are aligned with market cycles. We never compromise on stock cycles. We always want the very best. When the market is entering a new cycle, we want to find stocks that agree with that direction and are already in the “sweet spot” of their own cycle. This greatly increases our odds of success. If our timing on the market cycle is a bit early, these stocks will provide us with cushion. We find these stocks through searches and by setting alerts. You will find those articles in this course as well.</p>
