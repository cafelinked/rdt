<h4 class="wp-block-heading">These announcements will drive the price action for many weeks and often for the entire quarter. </h4>
<p>Earnings releases provide us with important insights on how well the company is performing and the earnings statement determines investor expectations. Asset Managers adjust their positions based on this news. The current stock price is a function of the expected future earnings. Large proprietary trading firms spend billions of dollars conducting “channel checks” and they talk to suppliers so they can gauge business conditions before the release. This research drives their valuation models. Earnings reactions produce the biggest stock moves of the year. When the performance and the guidance are materially different from analyst expectations, there is a price discovery process. The current stock valuation needs to be adjusted. There is a window of opportunity to join that move.</p>
<p>Buy and hold investors weather the earnings reports. They don’t care if the company had a bad quarter, they plan to hold the stock for years and they are only concerned with the long-term prospects. They read the earnings release to make sure that there have not been any material changes that would impact the future of the company. If everything is on track, they stick with the position. </p>
<p>Traders who have a holding pattern of three months or less should not hold positions over the earnings report. Many traders will attempt to predict the earnings reaction and this is pure gambling. They want the adrenaline rush that comes with a big move after an earnings announcement. This will be their chance to “win big”. They buy call (or put) options and they don’t know that the cards are stacked against them. Market Makers know that earnings releases generate big moves so the option premiums are sky high. Most of the time, the stock does not make the expected move that is priced into the options. These traders don’t spend billions of dollars on research, they are acting on a “gut feeling”. Stock traders will also find it impossible to predict earnings reactions. Often, a fantastic “beat” will result in a negative reaction. I can’t say this strongly enough, don’t hold trades over the earnings announcement!</p>
<p>There are plenty of opportunities before the earnings announcement. Some stocks have a historical tendency to rally two weeks ahead of the release and we have tracked this price behavior over the last few years. We have searches that tell us which companies will be reporting earnings in the next two weeks and which ones rally (or drop) into the number. We are not trying to predict the earnings reaction, we are just trading price action and we will exit before the release. If the stock is moving higher on heavy volume and it is strong relative to the market, we have an opportunity. Ideally, the stock is also breaking above technical resistance. Ride the momentum as long as it lasts, but exit before the earnings announcement. I suggest exiting the position the day before the release. Stocks will be choppy during the last trading session before the number and they will have random price movement. Institutions are making last minute adjustments to their positions and the action can be two-sided. </p>
<p>I’ve spent years experimenting with different methods to predict earnings reactions and I have reached a conclusion. This is an absolute coin toss and there is no way to consistently predict the reactions based on the price action ahead of the earnings release. I don’t have billions to spend on research and I don’t have access to that research. That means that others will always have the upper hand. Even if I had access to that research, the reaction is often not what we would expect. I’ve seen companies report much better than expected results and the stock declined after the news. I’ve seen companies miss expectations miserably and then rally after the news. </p>
<p>There is one earnings trade that works and I reference it in the Options Last section. It is non-directional trade and it capitalizes on the implied volatility spread between this week’s options and next week’s options. </p>
<p>When you consider the amount of time spent looking for earnings trades, entering them and then managing the reaction, it’s not worth the hassle. Holding over earnings releases is a 50:50 proposition and we avoid binary events. We can hit a 75% win rate or more if we stick to the system. The options bid/ask spreads widen out and it is difficult to exit the trade. There will be plenty of opportunities after the earnings release and we can trade the reaction.</p>
<p>This section focuses on longer-term stock selection so I will only discuss swing trading after the earnings release in this article. I will discuss shorter-term post earnings plays in the short-term section. </p>
<p>The initial reaction to an earnings release is not always indicative of where the stock is heading. Investors and speculators will adjust positions after the release and reversals are common. For instance, let’s say that the stock has rallied 20% into the number. Good news is priced in and the company substantially beat expectations. To the surprise of many, the stock declines after the earnings report. This reaction could just be profit taking. Once that supply of stock is worked off, buyers will still be engaged. The stock will erase the losses and rally to a new relative high. A weak stock that has been in a steady down trend could miss earnings expectations badly and gap higher after the report. Bad news was priced in and the announcement could be better than feared. That initial move sparks short covering and once that buying dries up, the longer-term sellers return and they drive the stock down. My point it that from a longer-term trading perspective, you should not take new swing trades based on the initial reaction because it is often false. You should wait 5-10 days for the dust to settle. By then it will show its “true colors”.</p>

<p>Stocks that make moves greater than 10% often blow through technical resistance levels. If they are in a longer-term up trend, they tend to hold the breakout. Not all of them, but most of them. We don’t have to chase the initial move, there will be plenty of opportunities. Ideally, the stock holds the opening price of the gap up and it advances during the first session after the release. If it closes higher, a green candle will form. A long green candle is preferred because that is a sign that buyers supported the gap up the entire day and they still viewed this as an attractive entry price. The strongest stocks will barely retrace that long green candle. They might test the middle of that candle, but the bid is so strong that the stock advances the next few days and it makes a new relative high. If you’ve waited at least a week, you have the confirmation you need that the stock is heading higher. </p>
<p>In the chart below you can see how the stock gapped up after earnings. On the charts an “A” represents earnings “after the close” and a “B” represents earnings “before the open”. The stock never tested the opening price from the gap and that is bullish. It continued to rally all day forming the long green candle. That is also bullish. During the next few days the stock barely tested the half-way point of the long green candle and that is also bullish. Buyers are supporting this move and it made a new relative high. This stock wants to go higher and now we have the technical confirmation we need to enter a swing trade. </p>

<p>In the next chart you can see how the stock gapped up after the earnings report, but it sold off the rest of the day. That resulted in a red candle and this is not ideal. This could still be bullish, but buyers did not support this move initially and that was a sign that more of the gap could fill. After a week of trading, the supply of stock was exhausted and it started to move higher. You would take a starter position when it makes a new relative high. It probed for support and it bounced above AVWAPE. This is a bullish sign and you would add to the position when it makes another relative high. You can see that the stock has retained its relative strength (RS).</p>

<p>Before we go any farther, it is important for you to set alerts. Set an alert at the high of the day for the first post-earnings candle. It might take a few days before that price point is breached, but it will be a reminder that the stock is ready to move higher. In Option Stalker Pro we have a search called Strong After Earnings. It searches for stocks that have reported earnings in the last two weeks, the stock gapped up and the last price is greater than the opening price of the initial reaction. In Option Stalker Pro, you can also search for stocks that recently released earnings and that are above AVWAPE. There many ways to set alerts and to run searches for earnings trades. We don’t want to miss these great opportunities.</p>
<p>Many traders will buy big gaps down and they will view this as an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. Not all gaps down are the same. The price action before the gap down is very important. If the stock has been generally trending higher, the gap down could be a buying opportunity. Buyers have been supporting the stock previously and good news is priced in. The pullback could just be profit taking. We need to give the stock at least a few days to settle down. In the chart below you can see how the stock rallied hard into the number. After the announcement it dropped and it found support. Now it has rallied above the 50-day MA and AVWAPE. It is filling the earnings gap and this would be a good entry point for a long. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dell061924-1024x868.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="01c72174-3d54-4047-86d4-4c7a6d19dfe6">

                    </div>
                
<p>In this example, the stock has been in a slight down trend before the earnings announcement. The reaction is negative and it falls below the 200-day MA. We need to give this stock lots of time to confirm support and a base needs to form over a period of many weeks. Once the stock starts to move through technical resistance levels, we can consider it as a long. Given the price action before the earnings announcement, I would tend to favor day trading the stock from the long side on notion that some of the gap will fill. I would not consider a swing trade until it can fill the gap and close above the 100-day MA. The risk of sellers keeping a lid on the bounce is still high and we need to make sure they are out of the way. A rally above the 100-day MA would indicate that the sellers are gone and the stock has lots of room to run. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>In this final example, the stock is in a long-term down trend. It gaps down on the earnings release. This is not a bargain and this is not a good entry for a long. Sellers are lined up. The stock tries to bounce and that move is easily squashed. When the stock makes a new relative low, it is a good short. It is below all of the major moving averages and AVWAPE. </p>

<p>Earnings reactions present some of the best trading opportunities for us. We rely heavily on technical breakouts and the price action tells us if the move is legitimate or fake. We just have to wait a week until we have technical confirmation one way or the other. Institutions are going to be adding or reducing exposure based on the number and the guidance. They want to minimize market impact so they spread their orders out over a period of days and perhaps weeks. This gives us time to evaluate the price action. If buyers are aggressive, we will see very little if any retracement after the earnings gap up. The stock will also be strong relative to the market and the green candles will outnumber the red. Stocks have a tendency to resume the previous trend that was in place before the earnings announcement. Macro business conditions that were present before the release don’t typically change quickly and they are likely to continue into the next quarter. </p>
<p>During earnings season it is important to know when similar companies are reporting. Some industry groups like airlines, basic materials and casinos have stocks that are highly correlated. If you own WYNN shares, you had better know when Las Vegas Sands is reporting. HD and LOW, CVX and XOM, LEN and TOL. These are other examples of stocks that are highly correlated. The earnings backdrop for one company is likely to be similar for peers. There are other companies that are unique and they are not highly correlated to other stocks. Microsoft and Meta are both tech companies, but the businesses are very different from each other. </p>
<p>Earnings season provides us with many trading opportunities. We can make money before the release and we can make money after the release by just trading price action and our odds are very high. Don’t hold trades over the announcement. Your odds of success are 50:50 and you should avoid binary events. </p>
