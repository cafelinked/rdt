<h4 class="wp-block-heading">This form of analysis determines the stock’s value. Some of this information is publicly available, but much of it is not. Research is extremely expensive and it is difficult to compete against large institutions at this level. </h4>
<p>Stock fundamental analysis measures the internal performance of a company and the macro business conditions they face. Technical analysis gauges the price movement of the stock. Many methods and metrics are used to conduct fundamental analysis. I am very comfortable reading financial statements, press releases and research reports, but the trade duration for this system is less than three months. The fundamentals don’t change that much in a quarter so we focus on technical analysis. Large financial institutions have better information than I do and that gives them an edge. They spend billions of dollars conducting “boots on the ground” analysis, conducting channel checks with suppliers, touring plants, tracking clinical trial results, sitting in courtrooms during patent litigation and talking to legislators who will be voting on new regulations. I don’t have the resources to compete with large institutions on a fundamental basis, so I don’t even try. Instead, I watch the technicals. We all have equal access to real-time price and volume and that tells us what the large institutions are doing. Our job is to follow the trail of bread crumbs they leave behind. With that in mind, let’s cover the basics of fundamental analysis. This is by no means a comprehensive course on this form of analysis, it is just an overview. &nbsp;</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>Let me first emphasize that longer-term traders and investors with trade durations that are longer than 3 months have to incorporate fundamental analysis into their game plan. If you hold positions for 6 months and longer, I consider you to be more of an investor and you need to lean more heavily on fundamental analysis than technical analysis. In this fast-paced world, conditions change quickly. Competition is fierce and there is always a “better mouse trap”. Consumer preferences can also change quickly.</p>
<p>One of my steadfast rules is that we do NOT hold trades over earnings announcements. We trade before the number and after the release. These are binary events and the stock can swing either way. I’ve seen stocks plunge after posting better than expected results and I’ve seen stocks that missed the number shoot higher. If our win rate on non-earnings trades is greater than 75%, why would we accept anything less? You can guess the earnings reaction correctly some of the time and get lucky. You might even go on a winning streak. Unfortunately, I have yet to meet anyone who can predict the reaction correctly 75% of the time over a large sample size. &nbsp;There is one earnings trade that works consistently, but it is non-directional and I will discuss it in the options section of the course. When you get the earnings reaction wrong, you are adjusting losing positions. That means you are distracted and you will miss great trades where you can hit your 75% win rate.&nbsp; When you get the reaction wrong, you are often “bag holding” because the stock will move adversely and it won’t retrace for many months (if at all). Your precious capital is tied up. This lesson took me years to learn and I did try to develop earnings systems. I was not able to outperform the results from this system. Now, I leave earnings trades for the institutions. We trade after the number where we can base our decisions on technical analysis, rather than a “gut feeling”.</p>
<p>Earnings announcements provide us with a window of opportunity. Institutions gauge the company’s performance and they compare them to their expectations. They scrutinize the financial statements, they review the guidance to catch a glimpse of the future and they ask “pointed” questions during the press conference. Stocks often make large moves after an earnings announcement. If there are material developments, the stock will go through a price discovery process where buyers and sellers digest the news and they act in accordance with their pricing models. Often the analysts adjust their expectations for future earnings. That discovery process presents trading opportunities for us and we will cover that extensively in the technical analysis section. We love trading after the number is posted. Here are some of the fundamentals that large institutions evaluate.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the Income Statement. You often hear the phrase “topline growth”. Revenue (sales) is the first item listed in this statement. It is a very important metric and it is perhaps the most important way to gauge a company’s performance. If revenues are not growing, no one is buying their product. New companies often have extreme revenue growth. They are just starting out so the comparisons (“comps”) to the previous quarter (q/q) or to the previous year (y/y) are easy to exceed because the company might not have had revenues. The company could also have a new product that is incredibly popular that generates robust sales. Some companies have stable revenues (Pepsi), some have cyclical revenues (General Motors) and some have seasonal revenues (Macy’s). Large mature companies like McDonalds will have gradual revenue increases in the low single digits y/y and new companies like Tesla will have explosive revenue growth that can be in the triple digits. There are tech companies like Twitter that did not have any revenue initially because they were focused on users and not monetization. We are only one paragraph into the Income Statement and you can see how difficult it can be to analyze revenue. In general, the goal for financial analysts is to compare the company’s revenue growth to industry peers and to the historic sales. They want to see that the company is developing new areas of revenue growth and that the company’s current product lines are healthy (consumers are buying their product). Analysts will also be gauging future revenue growth based on the guidance provided by the company. A decline in revenue growth that is not related to cyclicality or seasonality could be a warning sign to investors. Their product line is losing market share or the product’s life cycle is ending (VCRs).</p>
<p>The next section of the Income Statement includes all of the expenses. They are broken into two categories (Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses). We are not going to get that granular. The goal is to subtract all of the costs needed to generate the revenues (inventory, raw materials, office supplies, advertising, insurance, rent, legal, payroll, returns…) so that we can determine how much money the company actually made. If the company has robust revenue growth it would stand to reason that the expenses will also be higher. If the revenue growth is outpacing the increase in expenses, profits will expand. This could be due to economies of scale or because the company has large fixed expenses and low variable expenses (low incremental costs of production). &nbsp;Investors need to tread cautiously if expenses are rising faster than revenues. That is a sign that customers are not buying the product and that the company is not managing expenses. There might be reasons for this like the added costs of launching of a new product line. Analysts will be monitoring the situation very closely because profits will be declining. They want to feel optimistic about the investments the company is making. For example, Facebook recently changed its name to Meta and the investment into this new business was met with skepticism (the stock plunged).</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meta031223-1024x738.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="009279f0-424a-4a27-8f95-c5bf7a1a490c">

                    </div>
                
<p>Expenses are subtracted from revenues to determine earnings (also known as net income or profits). This is the last item on the Income Statement and it is also referred to as the “bottom line”. One of the most common ratios used by analysts is called Profit Margin. Net income divided by revenues reveals how efficiently the company is operating. Profit margins vary from one industry to another so peer comparisons are used to evaluate management as well as the comps (q/q and y/y). Companies that have high revenue growth, increasing profit margins and growing profits are obviously more attractive, but that will be reflected in the price of the stock. Companies that are struggling to generate revenue growth will often cut expenses to preserve earnings. This is a less attractive situation, but it could be due to a business cycle and not a fundamental change in the business. Companies that have deteriorating top and bottom line grow could be in trouble and they could set up well for shorting.</p>
<p>Balance Sheets subtract the company’s liabilities from its assets. The remainder is Shareholders Equity. I don’t want to dive too deep into balance sheet analysis. Investors want to make sure that current assets (cash and receivables) are greater than current liabilities (accounts payable and short term interest payments). If this is not true, the company might have to issue debt or shares to meet its short term obligations. Tech companies do not often have big fixed overhead so you might see situations where Current Assets exceed Total Liabilities (cash exceeds long-term and short-term liabilities). Companies with this type of balance sheet have extreme liquidity and they are able to weather adverse business conditions. Industries like airlines require large investments in long-term assets and they finance plant and equipment with long term debt. These companies have large fixed overhead expenses and they are exposed to economic downturns. During Covid-19, many airlines needed government assistance to maintain operations because revenues stopped immediately and they still had to cover their overhead expenses.</p>
<p>The last financial statement is called the Cash Flow Statement. It measures cash in and cash out. For many analysts this is the key metric because their models calculate the current value of a stock by discounting future cash flows (based on the company’s average cost of capital).</p>
<p>Quarterly earnings reports put extreme pressure on CEOs because their performance is only as good as the last quarter. Compensation packages are often based on the price of the stock and that short-term focus could jeopardize the company’s long-term prospects.</p>
<p>Financial statements reflect the current health of the company and many analysts use ratios to gauge performance. Here are the most widely followed metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue growth rate </strong>– The current revenue less the revenue from the prior period divided by the revenue from the prior period x 100. We want to buy companies that have strong top line growth.</p>
<p><strong>Net Profit Margin</strong> – Net income divided by total revenues x 100. Healthy net profit margins are a sign that top line growth is translating into bottom line growth. Management is effectively controlling expenses and competition might not be a factor.</p>
<p><strong>Earnings Growth Rate </strong>– Net income from this period less the net income from a prior period divided by the net income from the prior period. These comparisons can be q/q and y/y. Investors are looking for long-term consistency in earnings growth.</p>
<p><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS)</strong> – Net income divided by the shares outstanding. There are times when revenue and net income don’t increase much, but EPS move higher. This is often the result of stock buybacks. There are fewer shares outstanding and that increases the EPS.</p>
<p><strong>Trailing P/E Ratio</strong> – This is the current price of the stock divided by the EPS during the last 12 months. This is a valuation metric used by many analysts. A low trailing P/E ratio suggests that the stock price is attractive.</p>
<p><strong>Forward P/E Ratio </strong>– This is the current price of the stock divided by the forecasted EPS for the stock. Typically stocks are projected to make more than they did last year and this P/E is typically lower than the Trailing P/E. If the Trailing P/E is high and the Forward P/E is low, the expected earnings are projected to be very good. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PEG Ratio</strong> – The P/E ratio divided by the expected earnings growth rate. It factors in the growth rate and it is thought to provide a clearer representation of value. This is particularly true for high growth stocks that have a high P/E ratio. In general, a low PEG ratio is desired and a value of 1 is considered attractive. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quick Ratio </strong>– Cash and cash equivalents are divided by current liabilities. This ratio measures a company’s liquidity. A number greater than 1 means it can easily meet all of its short-term obligations. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Debt to Equity</strong> – Total Liabilities divided by Shareholders Equity. This ratio indicates how highly leveraged a company is. A low number is preferred and it indicates that the company is less risky. This number varies greatly from one industry to another so those comparisons are important.</p>
<p><strong>Book Value </strong>– Total Assets less Total Liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. This number indicates what the value per share would be if the company sold all of its assets and it settled all of its debts.</p>
<p><strong>Return on Equity</strong> – Net income divided by Shareholders Equity. This measures the percentage return on net assets (Total Assets minus Total Liabilities). The higher the number the better, but this is also industry specific.</p>
<p><strong>Dividend Yield</strong> – Total dividends paid per share divided by the share price. Some companies choose to pay investors on a regular basis. This payment has a tendency to attract conservative investors and money from balanced funds. If the stock does not appreciate in value, shareholders will still receive a return from the dividends. Some analysts argue that the company has run out of attractive investments and that is why it is returning capital to investors. In general, these stocks tend to have less volatile price action because the investors don’t move in and out of the stock with frequency. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>% Institutional Holdings</strong> – The number of shares held by large institutions is divided by the total number of shares outstanding. A large number indicates that the ownership is stable. Institutions tend not to move in and out of a stock with frequency and the price action should be less volatile.</p>
<p><strong>% Short</strong> – The shares sold short are divided by the total shares outstanding. A high percentage indicates severe pessimism. Institutions and retail traders have to find shares to be able to short them. If the shares become unavailable for borrow, these traders could be forced to buy back the shares. That could result in a short squeeze where the stock shoots higher and it forces short sellers out of the position.</p>
<p><strong>Days to cover</strong> – This is the number of shares shorted (short interest) divided by the 20-day average daily volume for the stock. A large number would indicate that the stock is heavily shorted and that it will take many days for shorts to cover their positions.</p>
<p>This is a basic overview of financial statements and key ratios used by analysts. Each quarter you can read the quarterly earnings report. If you are a longer term trader or investor, I suggest looking at the growth numbers and key ratios. Read the guidance provided in the earnings report and when possible listen to the press conference after earnings are posted.</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis also considers macro events that are going to impact the company. Here are some of those considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory</strong> – The regulatory environment could increase costs. Strict EPA laws, OSHA safety codes and labor laws are only a few examples and the regulatory backdrop changes constantly. Large trading firms know legislators who are going to be voting on new regulations and they know which way the “wind is blowing”. Congressmen can trade on this information legally and they have inside information. This is NOT a level playing field.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes and subsidies</strong> – Corporate taxes impact companies. These laws change frequently and business compete on a global basis. Where a company is located might present tax advantages. Many corporations moved their offices to Ireland for this reason. Subsidies might encourage investments in plant and equipment for certain manufacturers and that will impact profits. Again, inside information prevents us from competing with trading firms that know which way the “wind is blowing”.</p>
<p><strong>Interest rates</strong> – Monetary tightening makes it more expensive for companies to borrow money. Rising interest rates will also make it more expensive for consumers to buy homes, cars and appliances. Fed tightening often leads to a slowdown in economic activity and companies have to adjust their forecasts.</p>
<p><strong>Litigation</strong> – Lawsuits can be filed by individuals (personal injury), shareholders (fiduciary negligence), other companies (patent infringement) or the government (anti-trust). We live in a litigious society and corporations can be sued on many different levels. Large institutions monitor lawsuits closely and they gauge the possible outcomes and potential damages. This is another example of information that we do not have access to. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong> – As completion increases, profit margins decline. This will impact profits.</p>
<p><strong>Product Life Cycle</strong> – The life cycle for a primary product might be nearing its end. Once example might be a drug company that is about to lose its patent on a popular drug. Generic versions will greatly reduce the profit margins. In some cases, new technology could make the product obsolete (VCRs).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Trials</strong> – The FDA approval process is rigorous and expensive. The results of clinical trials will have a huge impact on a biotech company’s stock price and it will impact their ability to raise capital. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong> – Inflation impacts input costs. Raw materials and higher labor costs will bite into profits and the company might see a large decline in revenues if they increase the price of their product.</p>
<p><strong>Economic cycles</strong> – Some companies are cyclical. Purchases of heavy equipment are postponed during economic declines. The depth and duration of economic downturns is difficult to predict and the company will need a strong balance sheet to ride out the cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Credit</strong> – Tight credit conditions will make it more expensive for companies to borrow capital. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis banks were shoring up their own balance sheets and new loans were very difficult to secure.</p>
<p><strong>Supply disruptions</strong> – During Covid-19 global shutdowns created long-term supply disruptions that took years to resolve. One small product component or one raw material could completely halt production.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong> – Consumers will buy more snow boots and coats during a cold winter. Natural disasters can destroy plant and equipment. The Tsunami in Japan caused a nuclear plant shutdown and it impacted the power grid. Hurricane Katrina destroyed manufacturing facilities in Louisiana. Drought impacts crops and the demand for agricultural equipment.</p>
<p><strong>New Technology </strong>– New technology can replace old products/services with blinding speed. My option order execution business is a classic example. The method that had been used for two hundred years was obsolete in the course of two years. Automated driving systems are going to dramatically change the transportation industry in the next decade.</p>
<p>As you can see, fundamental analysis can be very complicated. When I started my career in finance some stocks were referred to as being stable enough for “widows and orphans”. Those included AT&amp;T and General Electric. It was common for investors to buy shares of a company and to actually take physical delivery of the shares. They had no intention of ever selling the stock. Investing and trading have changed. Sociological changes (the need for immediate results), trading technology (high frequency trading), the availability of information (internet), technological advancements in products (computers) and globalization (consumers can buy anywhere) have all reduced the holding period for traders and investors. Companies that were dominant in a particular industry for decades suddenly find themselves in survival mode.</p>

<p>I did not intend for this to be a comprehensive guide to fundamental analysis. This article barely scratches the surface. Instead, I wanted to point out how difficult it is to value a company. Fundamental analysis tries to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued. There are many considerations and they are constantly changing. Large financial institutions employ hundreds of analysts and they have incredible resources that they dedicate to research. They have better information and I can’t compete with them when it comes to fundamental research. I want to follow the “smart money”. When they are buying or selling stock, I can see that in the price action. We all have access to this information and that is why the rest of this Stock section is dedicated to technical analysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
