<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stocks that make large intraday moves on heavy volume have material news.</h4>
<p>Often, a major stock announcement hits during market hours. Sometimes the news is material and sometimes it is not. The key is separating the good from the bad and the Option Stalker Pro Explosion Alerts attempt to do that. Not everything that glitters is gold. Here are some tips that will help you. </p>
<p>Newswires are constantly scanning for announcements and some services like TradeXchange are excellent. The problem is that there is never a shortage of releases and you spend much of your time trying to filter out the garbage. If the news is truly material, it will impact the price of the stock and institutions will jump on it. Our explosion alerts are going to pick up on the volume spike and the movement before any of the newswires can report on it, and we want to be the first ones in the trade. That means we are going to be early and we need to identify what the “legitimate” reactions look like. </p>
<p>We collect the volume for every 5 minute interval during the trading day and we calculate the 20-day average volume for every 5 minute interval. The volume for the first 5 minutes of the trading day is greater than a 5 minute interval during the middle of the day, so we want to make sure we are comparing “apples with apples.” During the day, we could have many candidates and we need to filter them out as much as possible. Stocks need to have a minimum 20-day average volume of at least 1 million shares and they need to be greater than $5 in price. We don’t want to bother with low priced penny stocks. If the volume for the current M5 bar is multiples higher than the average and if the stock price jumps, we have a candidate.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Here_s_What_we_Want">Here’s What we Want</h2>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The ideal candidate has a very long M5 green candle that closes on it’s high with little to no wick. Why is this first candle so important? That is a sign that buyers can’t get enough. They are going to gobble up everything in sight. If there is a long wick, it is a sign that sellers have not been completely deterred. You need to make a decision on this first candle. The news has still not hit the wires so time is of essence. </li>
<li>The long green M5 candle that triggered the alert has to be so large that it breaches a significant D1 resistance level. In the case below, it broke through the 50-day MA and two long-term High- trendlines. Those are natural resistance levels and the buying was significant enough to blow through those levels. </li>
<li>Don’t mess around with options. By the time you load your options chains and decide on which strike and month to buy, the news might have hit the wires. Once the stock starts to move, auto-quote used by Market Makers will already be adjusting the price of the options (IV spike) and the bid/ask will widen out. Just buy the stock and get some exposure. If you have time, you can double back around and buy options. When we hit the real deal, the stock never looks back.</li>
<li>If you recognize the symbol, there is a good chance the stock will go. Large companies have large floats and they are hard to move. The daily volume is heavy (thick) and there are always plenty of buyers and sellers. These stocks are like battleships. When there is a substantial volume spike and when the price of the stock moves enough to breach technical resistance, the news is material.</li>
<li>We would like to see the second stacked long green candle on massive volume and ideally it does not have much of a wick either. If you get this formation, the stock could get halted. This is a sign that the news is material. </li>
<li>We want the volume to stay very heavy and to ramp up. That tells us that institutions read the news and that they are buying.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Here_s_What_to_Avoid">Here’s What to Avoid</h2>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>We don’t want stocks that have recently made big moves. Those stocks are already on everyone’s radar. They are vulnerable to rumors and the vast majority of those moves are fake. Once takeover rumors start, they tend to recirculate. The stock will have many fake “pops” that quickly fizzle out. We want stocks that have been in a nice orderly trading pattern prior to the explosion alert. This news needs to appear out of nowhere.</li>
<li>We don’t want choppy stocks that often move in fits and spurts. Biotech stocks would be one example. </li>
<li>We don’t want that first candle to have a long wick for bullish explosions. We want buyers to be so aggressive that they rip every ask in sight and then they go hunting for more. Any effort to test the bid on the first M5 bar should be destroyed. “How many more you got?”</li>
<li>We don’t want a second candle to have a wick that is equal to the size of the body (or more). Remember, we want relentless buying and that wick is a sign that sellers were able to knock the stock down from the high of that bar.</li>
<li>We don’t want to see the heavy volume subside quickly. That will be a sign that buyers are not that interested and that the news was not that material.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="How_to_Trade_Explosion_Alerts">How to Trade Explosion Alerts</h2>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First of all, decide if you have the stomach for these. You will be forced to take action with very little information. Start small until you get a feel for these explosion patterns. </li>
<li>Trade shares of the stock and not options. You want to get in and if you monkey around with options you will miss the best ones because they will not pause and they will not retrace.</li>
<li>There will be some retracement while the current bar is forming after you have entered the trade so don’t panic. The important thing is that the stock closes near the high of the M5 candle. </li>
<li>If the stock is halted, don’t panic. You are on the right side of this news. You should actually welcome a halt because the stock is likely to jump higher when it reopens.</li>
<li>If you start to see the volume wane and if you start to notice wicks, take gains. You don’t have to exit all at once, scale out. </li>
<li>You need to enter early. If you miss the first two bars, leave it alone. That is often the “meat” of the move. The real deals go quickly and you do not want to chase. </li>
<li>Always trade in the initial direction of the move. If there is a big jump up in the stock price, never short it no matter how convinced you are that the move is fake. It is possible on a big move up you will see a contra move and a bearish explosion alert. Do not short. This is a very important note. Once you see a contra explosion alert, this becomes a normal trade and not an explosion trade that never looks back. I allow these because the stock is moving and it could still be attractive. These contra alerts will often provide an entry point to join the original move higher. Set an alert at the open from the long red candle that generated the bearish explosion alert. If the stock gets back above that level, you might have a good entry for a long. Typically, I don’t mess with these and I am only interested in the first move. Contra bullish and bearish explosion alerts are a sign of volatility.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Recap">Recap</h2>
<p>Let’s recap. We are looking for major news that will have a material impact on the price of the stock and the earnings of the company. Huge volume spikes and large price movement during the day are a sign that there is an announcement. We want relentless buying on the first M5 candle and we want it to close very near the high. We want that M5 bar to breach D1 technical resistance. If we know the company, chances are the stock is fairly liquid and that increases the odds of the move being legitimate. Those stocks are hard to move and explosion alerts on mega cap stocks are rare (but very lucrative). We need to enter quickly. There is no time to search for the news or to play around with options. Buy the stock. We want the second candle to be strong as well and we want the huge volume to continue. If we start to see wicks and tails that retrace more than half of the previous candle, it is a sign that the buying is not relentless and that there are some sellers. Take some gains. If the volume starts to wane, take the remaining gains. </p>
<p>The vast majority of these will be “hit and run” trades. You will be in and out within 30-60 minutes. A few times a year, we might hit a takeover or a spin-off. Those are huge movers, but they are the exception and not the rule. In those instances, you will know because the stock never looks back and you have time to read the news. I will post future charts for alerts that were good and bad so that you can develop a feel for them. </p>
