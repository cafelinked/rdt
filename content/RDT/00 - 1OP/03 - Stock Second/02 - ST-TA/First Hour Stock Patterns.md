<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Novice traders will chase “hot” stocks in the first hour. Here are the most common patterns you will see and here’s how to trade these stocks. </h4>
<p>There is an old market adage that “the open is for amateurs and the close is for professionals”. In my years of experience, this is VERY true. “FOMO Joe” can’t wait for the opening bell. He turns on his screens and he looks for pre-open gainers. He rushes in and buys “hot” stocks. He doesn’t have any price data for the stock that might confirm that it is going to move higher and he has not had time to monitor the market to see if he has a headwind or a tailwind. The stock turns to mush an hour later and then I get questions that go something like this. “Pete, the stock broke out through D1 resistance and it had stacked green candles on heavy volume. I bought it 30 minutes after the open and then the stock dropped. What did I miss?” The information we get during the first hour of trading is valuable. It is going to greatly increase our odds of success. Here are some of the patterns you need to be aware of and some of the issues you will be dealing with. For the examples below know that we are in a bullish market and that we are only looking for “longs”. </p>
<p>The excitement of making money is so great that many traders can’t resist temptation. They watch the first few bars and they are green and long. The prevailing thought is, “Dang I knew this stock was going to run. I should have bought the open. I’ve been taught to be patient so I will wait.” Then they watch a few more green candles stack and they lament. They think about how much money they could have made if they bought the open and they witness incredible strength. If they had just bought the stock earlier and if they had just ignored these stupid rules, they would have made so much money. The trader is convinced that the stock is going higher so they buy it 30 minutes after the open. They are aware that it might retrace so they convince themselves that they are going to “weather the storm”. “Surely a stock with this level of strength is not going to roll over and “play dead”. Any dip will be brief and shallow.” Then the stock starts to tick lower. The selling pressure gradually builds and the open from the gap up fails. They didn’t expect that and now fear of losing money is overpowering greed. The stock moves into the gap and the bottom drops out. They bail on the trade and they take large losses. The lesson they learned is that the “game is rigged”. Institutions fabricated the move higher so that the “little guy” gets lured in and then they slammed the door in their face. If that’s what you learned, great! Don’t repeat the mistake and don’t trade in the first hour. </p>
<p>“But Pete, some of the biggest moves happen on the open!” That is correct. There is a price discovery process for stocks and for the market in the first hour. Large institutions run programs to test both sides and they are trying to determine the path of least resistance. We need that information, just like they do. Once we have it, we can take action with confidence and our odds of success are much higher. If our entry is less than perfect, we can weather a little volatility because we have that data. The fact that the market makes some of the biggest moves in the first hour is irrelevant. Risk and reward go hand in hand. Your losses and your gains will be much greater if you trade the first hour and your win rate will be 50%. Those odds stink.</p>
<p>Some traders will argue that a 50% win rate is OK because their winners will be bigger than their losers when they trade the first hour. For 99.9% of traders, this is hogwash. If that were the case then every Day Trader would buy “hot” stocks on the open and sell them for a gain. There would be millions of Day Traders making a lot of money. That is simply not reality. The other issue with a 50% win rate is that you are a “wet sloppy mess” mentally. Half of the trades you take lose money. Traders need positive reinforcement. That is the source of their confidence and their win rate has to be 75% at minimum. The pros I know have much higher win rates. They don’t trade in the first 30 minutes. In rare instances they might trade after that, but 45 minutes is still considered early. Sometimes, they will wait 90 minutes for the right day trading set up. </p>
<p>Before I go any farther, I am going to mention a couple of things. There are a handful of VERY skilled professional traders who can navigate the open. They can buy opens and they know based on all of the available information which stocks will run and which ones are “fake”. They will have sell orders ready and they will be out before the “music stops”. They will also fade gaps up that are reversing even when the pro knows they are trading against the longer-term up trend. These traders are full-time professionals and they have many years of experience. I can trade like this and I have traded like this. For 99.9% of traders, this is not the way to make money day trading and these trades comprise a very small fraction of my overall trading. When I am flipping charts and looking for prospects, I will see these set-ups and I will trade them, but I am not looking for them. The lessons I am going to teach you are what I spend virtually all of my time on.</p>
<p>In general, if the stock has a big gap up on the open that is greater than 5%, much of the move has been realized. Translation: There is no more gas left in the tank! These are typically earnings gaps. If the stock gaps up more than 5% and it is not earnings related, there is other news. If it is through major resistance levels on massive volume and relative strength, it has a chance to go. This gap up tells you that it was unexpected news and that it is material to future earnings. Folks, these are VERY rare situations and you might see one or two of these in an entire month. In the chart below you can see a stock that had excellent mid-stage clinical trial results for a new weight loss drug. OK, this is one of those exceptions and you can see the relative strength all day. It gapped up 80% and it still had room to run. </p>

<p>When a stock gaps 5% higher post earnings it might hold the gains, but it doesn’t advance. If the market is retracing during the first hour, the stock will even have relative strength. “Pete, the stock had relative strength and the market rallied, but the stock didn’t. What happened?” It used all of it energy on the initial move and some traders saw that as an opportunity to take profits. Buyers were still engaged and they supported the stock, but that pressure was barely enough to offset the selling by profit takers. These set-ups have a very poor day trading risk/reward profile. </p>

<p>When the market gaps up, most stocks will gap up. That makes it very difficult to identify which moves are “real” and which ones are just moving in sympathy with the market. The first thing you need to ask yourself is, “Why is the company worth so much more overnight?” Was there some major news that will materially impact long-term profits? Typically, the answer is no. Before you hit the buy button, search the news to see what’s driving the action. If there isn’t any news, the move is technical. It’s very likely that the move will retrace. The next question you should ask yourself is, “What does the company do?” There is no reason for a maker of toothpaste to spike higher the next day. There isn’t any news that is going to have a major impact on the toothpaste market. We need to make sure that the move up is genuine so check the news. Look at the previous price action for the stock on an M5 basis. Often you will find that it makes big runs early in the day and then it retreats. From everything you’ve read you should start the day with skepticism. Know that big moves up or down by the market or the stock should be questioned. The chances of a “gap reversal” are greater than a “gap and go”. The risk profile for a “gap reversal” is more attractive than a “gap and go”. That means that we need confirmation that buyers are interested. The chart below is a classic example. “FOMO Joe” thinks he has all of the “checkboxes” marked for a good day trade. The stock has a strong D1 and it is above the prior day’s high. It is stacking green M5 candles and the volume is above average. He buys shortly after the open. The M5 chart is much more convincing, but I used an M15 chart below so that you can see the previous price action. He is oblivious to what the company does. In this case it is a heavy equipment manufacturer. There is no news to justify the overnight gap. The current price action for the day is nice, but the previous price action tells the entire story. This is a choppy stock and we can see that if we just look back a few days. He buys early in the day and an hour later he takes a beating. He should have waited and he should have set alerts to buy dips because those are common for this stock. The next day he repeats the same mistake. This time the market reversed after an hour of trading. He “jumped the gun”. If he had waited, he would have seen that the market was weak.</p>

<p>So let’s look at the chart below and start with the pattern closest to the top and work our way down. In the first case, the stock either gaps up more than 5% or it spikes much more than the 20-day ATR (average true range). In general, we do not want to chase these moves. Take a look at how the stock traded previously and check the news. Most if not all of the move has been realized early. That means any additional upside is limited. Gap reversals are very possible and those losses will be huge because there is plenty of downside and there is time for the drop to gain momentum. That means the risk/reward profile is terrible. There is no reason to chase these stocks. Set an alert to buy a dip. If it is brief and shallow, you might have an opportunity to take an overnight late in the day. This is not a good day trading candidate. The stock will be much more volatile. That means it will be harder to add to the position during the day. These dips will be deep and each one could be deeper. Your confidence in this pattern will be lower than some of the other patterns you can be trading.</p>
<p>The second pattern from the top (light blue solid line) can be decent, but we need to make sure that the moderate gap up holds before we buy. First of all, what is moderate? Half of the 20-day ATR or less would be moderate. The first thing you should do is to check the D1 chart. Is this a continuation to a D1 breakout? Ideally, it is. If the market is gapping up, we have to use greater caution because the stock could be following the market. Make sure that the opening price for the stock is preserved. That would be a sign that buyers are supporting the gap up. You are “paying up” for the stock compared to where it closed yesterday. Check the news and make sure that there is some substance to it. Once the stock holds the opening gap we can watch for heavy volume and relative strength. These stocks can be good candidates, but we need to use greater caution compared to the “grinder” I’ll mention next. We want this stock to spend the majority of its time above VWAP.</p>
<p>The dark blue dotted line is the best pattern. The stock did not gap up and we don’t feel like we are chasing. Ideally, this stock has previously demonstrated orderly price action and the D1 chart is strong with a breakout through resistance the previous day or the current day. It is above the prior high and it is grinding higher in a very orderly fashion. It did not pullback on the open and that would be a great sign if it happened during a lower market open. We would like to see good volume. After the first couple of hours we can witness relative strength vs the SPY. In that time we are likely to have at least a small pullback in the SPY. During that time, the stock did not flinch (it didn’t retrace) and it might have kept grinding higher. This is our opportunity to add to the position!! This is where the boring old grinder will out perform the “high flier”. We have the confidence we need to add to the position because it keeps telling us it is going higher. The orderly price action tells us institutions are interested. Most of the candles will be green and the bodies will be relatively small. That’s great because the stock is not getting ahead of itself. We might be able to add to the position a few times. Often these stocks will accelerate late in the day. Buyers will get more aggressive and you will have fantastic gains. You want to see the stock above VWAP the vast majority of the day. The high fliers jumped early so the VWAP is high. The stocks often spend a lot of time above and below it for that reason. Focus on the “grinder” pattern instead. Like I mentioned earlier, D1 breakouts through horizontal resistance, a major SMA, AVWAPE or a trendline make this pattern even more attractive. Early in the day the stock is a bit sluggish because traders are waiting to see if that breakout holds. As the day progresses, it becomes more obvious that it is going to clear it and that is when you can expect some acceleration. You have the confidence to add to the position because the stock is so consistent and that gives you much greater upside potential vs trading “high fliers” that gapped up. </p>
<p>The final pattern below is the light blue dotted line (lowest line). This can also be a great pattern. Most stock searches will look for early strength and for breakouts on volume. These stocks opened “soft” and they will fly under the radar for a while. The way to find them early is to look for bullish longer-term variables and weakness for those same variables on an M5 basis. In Option Stalker Pro you can find these stocks in all of the searches. Just look for red M5 dots in the search columns with green across all of the longer time frames. That tells you that the stock is incredibly strong on a longer-term basis. It might be pulling back a little because the market is down or it might be going through a bid check after posting nice gains the previous day. We don’t have to worry about chasing the stock because it is starting the day off on a soft note. We don’t want the stock to be down more than half of the prior day’s range. We want those advances to be preserved. Ideally, the stock preserves the VWAP from the previous day. We also don’t want to see any stacked red candles early in the day (those would be a sign of selling pressure). Stocks that closed near the high of the day the previous day have demonstrated nice strength particularly if those gains were substantial. A small pullback in the current day will test the bid and the stock will be within striking distance of that prior day’s high. Provided that the market is stable, we want to see the stock find early support and we want to see it gather strength in the first hour (or less). That would be a sign that buyers are still eager to buy any dip. This is an attractive pattern for many reasons. You are not chasing so you have lots of time to enter. You are getting in at a good price and support has been confirmed. Buyers are scooping up any dip and you can add on a new high for the day and add on a breakout above the prior high. If the price action is orderly, you can also add on relative strength when the market finds support after a period of weakness. The key to day trading stems from the confidence to hold the position and the confidence to add to it. You won’t have this mental fortitude for stocks that are flying around all over the place. </p>

<p>The chart below is an example of a stock that had the light blue dashed pattern I referenced in the chart above. It had a nice move higher the previous day. It closed on the high of the day when the market dropped late in the day. This is a sign of strength and the volume was heavy. The next day the market sold off hard on the open. The stock pulled back a little, but it quickly gained strength when the market continued to drop. If you were expecting a market bounce, it made a nice move higher and there was money to be made buying this stock. Unfortunately, the market never recovered so you had to take gains. Even the strongest stocks intraday will succumb to a very weak market. In the chart you will also notice how the market opened higher the next day and the stock shot higher. The signs that buyers were interested were easy to spot during the prior days. </p>

<p>The first hour of the trading session is “amateur hour”. The only thing most pros are doing during that time is taking gains on overnights. Know that what looks great 30 minutes after the open often looks like garbage 30 minutes later. Retain your control as long as possible. If you are extremely tempted to buy, set alerts and wait for a dip. These alerts take a few seconds to set. When you get a dip, evaluate how long it lasted and how far the stock dropped. We want them to be brief and shallow. The first hour of trading provides us with valuable information about the stock and the market. If you don’t wait for that information your odds of success are much lower. Don’t cheat yourself. We need to increase our odds so that we can stay mentally positive. Spend most of your time looking for stocks that opened a little higher or lower (the dashed lines in the chart) and that have a great D1 strength. “Grinders” that are building on yesterday’s gains and that have taken out the prior day high on good volume make excellent day trading prospects. It will be easy to add to these positions because the price action is so consistent. Stocks that make monster moves on the open will be volatile. These are your worst prospects because the upside potential is limited and the downside risk is great. Don’t be “FOMO Joe”. </p>
<p>If the market is in a longer-term down trend and if you are looking for bearish day trades, don’t chase stocks that have big gaps/moves lower in the first hour. Look for the weak D1 charts where the stock is opening fairly close to the prior close. The logic is the same as I’ve outlined above. You want the stock to gradually tick lower after a flat open. Add on confirmation and look for the move to accelerate.</p>
