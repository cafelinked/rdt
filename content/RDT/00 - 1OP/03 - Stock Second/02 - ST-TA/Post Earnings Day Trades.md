<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Earnings releases provide us with new information and this can lead to large moves. Here’s how to day trade them.</h4>
<p>Every quarter we get an update on the company’s performance and a glimpse at the future. Analysts compare the actual results to their estimates and they adjust their valuations. Stock prices move rapidly after the news and this creates a trading opportunity for us. As I mentioned in a previous article, the initial moves can be misleading for swing trades and the stock has to settle down for a week or two before we can reach any swing trading conclusions. During the initial price discovery process, there are day trading opportunities. Here is the price action you should watch for. </p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics. First of all, 90% of earnings releases don’t produce the consistent price action we need for day trading. In some cases the analysts got it right and the stock does not have much of a reaction. Stocks that have been trapped in a long-term horizontal trading range often stay in that range. In these instances, the stock has to clear all resistance and open above it. Make sure there is absolutely no resistance above. Think of the stock as a rocket that has just gone into outer space. That is the pattern you want. If the stock has broken support, there is nothing below and it is falling into the Mariana Trench. Some stocks are naturally choppy and they have a random component to the price action. In these cases the gap up has to be huge and very convincing. We need dominant one-sided price action, not chop. There are also boring companies that produce consistent results. Big moves and earnings “surprises” are rare and big initial reactions often fizzle quickly. Again, think in terms of unusually large moves when you compared them to previous earnings reactions. There has been a material change in the company and that is why the stock is making a big move.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is a financial institution. It has a fairly predictable business model and investment banks do not typically make big surprise moves. That’s not to say that it can’t make a big move, we just don’t expect to see that and we need to investigate what might be causing it. In the chart below you can see that the stock has been trending higher in a choppy fashion with lots of mixed candles and overlap. The “B” to the right of the chart means that the company announced earnings before the open. Days before the news, the stock broke out to a new relative high on good volume. Other banks had reported and that was driving the stock. After the earnings report you can see the last candle has a long wick. That tells us that at some point during the day, it was forming a long green candle that looked legitimate at the time.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>The chart below shows us what the stock did intraday. It gapped down slightly and then it had nice stacked long green candles on heavy volume. This looked like a nice gap reversal. Every stock is going to have heavy volume on a relative basis after it posts earnings so keep that in mind. Why did the stock pullback initially? This is a warning sign because there were some sellers. If the news was incredibly good, the stock would not have pulled back. We can see that there is some overlap in the candles and we know from the longer-term chart that the stock does not typically make big moves. I used this as an example because it illustrates how post earnings moves can look good initially and then fail. This stock is not the exception, it is the rule. Most post-earnings moves don’t set up well for day trading and the clues are in the longer-term chart. This is an important concept. The vast majority of post earnings day trades are “noisy” and you need to remember this. Make sure that all of the characteristics in the rest of the article are firmly in place and be very selective.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ms072424a-1024x801.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="9749cc9d-0d9a-4407-8a8f-cc6e5ac44dd1">

                        </a>
                        <div class="h6 fst-italic mt-3 mt-md-0 ms-md-4 gallery-caption"></div>
                    </div>
                
<p>So here are the characteristics you should look for. We want nice orderly price action on the longer-term chart and ideally the stock is trending. Horizontal compressions are also good because the stock is coiled like a spring and the stock is ready to release. We want nice clean breakouts through major resistance after the earnings announcement and a gap up that easily clears that resistance. This is an important point. We don’t want the stock poking at the resistance level and trying to break through it, we want the stock to obliterate that resistance level like it wasn’t even there. The low of the day should not be anywhere close to that previous resistance and the after-hours/pre-open low should not be close to it. Buyers need to be “over the top” excited by the news and they are gobbling up shares after the release. It is always good to check the earnings report to see what’s changed. In doing so, you will learn more about the company and this knowledge will help you in the future. </p>
<p>It is best if the stock has been in a horizontal range (neutral) or trending in the direction of the gap before the earnings announcement. The company has been performing and it is exceeding expectations. Perhaps it has a new product. Tech companies have new innovations that can dramatically impact profitability and material news of this nature produces sustained moves. Use greater caution when the earnings gap is contrary to the longer-term trend. “Dogs” that have been in a steady decline will often bounce after a lackluster earnings report that was “better than feared”. This is just a short covering bounce and eventually sellers will return. Conversely, a stock that is at an all-time high and in a strong up trend might gap down due to profit taking. The rally was over-extended and good news was priced in. As long as the earnings were good, it’s just a matter of time until buyers return. Yes, some of these contra moves will be fine for day trading. Read the earnings report and gauge if there has been a material change in the company that will impact future profits. My point is that you need to use greater care trading these gaps that are contra to the longer-term trend. </p>
<p>Two more words of caution – Market First! In the chart below CVNA had a nice D1 breakout to a new all-time high after reporting earnings. It gapped up and when the market was drifting lower it held all of its gains. That is a sign that buyers are lined up and that the stock wants to go higher. When the market made a new low for the day, there was no reason to enter the trade. Wait for market support. In this instance, the bottom of the market fell out and there was a bearish trend day. CVNA held strong, but eventually it caved in. In rare instances, stocks will hold up and even move higher when the market is tanking. When you see that, it tells you the stock is going higher. Buyers are lined up and you just have to wait for the market to find support. We don’t often get bearish trend days. If the market drop is wimpy you can take a small starter long and add to it when the market bounces. </p>

                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cvna080124-1024x716.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="5e1c8e68-b5aa-4939-9e82-7a9f59a247ed">

                    </div>
                
<p>In the chart below we can see a stock that spent an entire quarter compressing (shaded area). It has been chopping back and forth and the earnings announcement produced a big breakout. Notice how the stock did not just poke at the resistance level, it blew through it cleanly. The low of the day was no where near that prior resistance. There was a material change in the company’s performance and buyers are aggressive. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/lmt072424-1024x782.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="f6bf6cdb-09f6-4bdb-b5ca-112cd33d3bf4">

                    </div>
                
<p>In the intraday chart below we can see that the stock gapped up. It held the gains during the first hour of trading and if this gap up was all “fluff”, sellers would have taken profits and knocked it back into the D1 trading range. That didn’t happen. The biggest “tell” came when the market dropped mid-day (gray line). During that market drop, the stock made a new high for the day. This is a sign of relative strength. These buyers don’t care that the market pulled back, they are buying this stock with the intent to hold it long-term. This would be a safe entry point to buy the stock. As the day progresses, the market continues to show signs of weakness, but the stock is oblivious to it. It is on a mission and this is the steady grind higher we want to see. This type of price action also tells us that the stock could be good on a swing basis. By the end of the day, the market closes on its low of the day and the stock closes on its high of the day. </p>

                    </div>
                
<p>Here’s another example of a stock that was in a tight compression before the earnings release. It broke through the D1 horizontal resistance, but it did not obliterate it. That means we need to use greater caution. The stock needs “escape velocity” from that compression and it doesn’t have it. It was in a strong uptrend previously. After a few months of rest it could be ready for the next leg higher. </p>

<p>The intraday chart below provided us with some clues that the stock was going higher. The initial gap up was not overly impressive. Typically, we want to see stronger price action. The news has to be so good that buyers are anxious to buy shares. It has nice green candles with some overlap. On the left side of the chart you can see that the SPY (gray line) opened flat. The SPY moved higher and dipped, but the stock advanced on a long green candle. This would be easier to see if we had two M5 charts side-by-side and I suggest you always have them on your screen for tick-by-tick comparison. When the SPY has a long red candle, you want the stock to advance on a long green candle. That is a sign that buyers are aggressive. You could have taken a small starter position here. The stock compresses and it holds all of the gains while the SPY is dropping. This is a sign of relative strength. When the SPY finds support and the stock makes a new high for the day, you can add to the position. The “tell” to exit the trade came when the market bounced and the stock barely advanced. That was a warning sign that the move could be exhausted. Off of the high of the day, the stock M5 candle finished with a bearish hammer and the market was still moving higher. This is when you would take your gains. Set an alert at the high of the day, the stock might give you another opportunity. </p>
<p>As the day unfolds, the market is weak (middle of chart). The SPY (gray line) makes a new low for the day and the stock compresses (shaded). It held most of the gains so it is strong relative to the market. Set an alert above the compression. The market is finding support at the low of the day and the stock breaks out of the compression. This is where you can try a starter long. The entry is good and the stock moves higher providing you with instant cushion. You can place a stop at your entry price so that you have no risk in the trade. The market bounces, but the stock quickly retraces and you scratch the trade. We knew from the D1 chart that this was not the “gangbuster breakout” we want so we needed to use caution. There was still money to be made, but I wanted to provide you with a “marginal” example so that you can see how you should manage the trade. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ge072424a-1024x783.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="2b251ecb-419c-4c16-9802-48298da7973d">

                    </div>
                
<p>There will also be big gaps down after earnings announcements. In the chart below you can see how the stock blew through major D1 horizontal support. This demonstrates heavy selling pressure and it is the type of set up we look for. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ups072424a-1024x899.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="c626ac91-9319-4713-81ea-229a5060d253">
                            <img src="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ups072424a-1024x899.png" alt="">

                    </div>
                
<p>In the M5 chart below we can see the big gap down. Sometimes these big moves exhaust all of the downside during the initial move. We have to use caution because a gap reversal is possible and it could lead to large losses if we short too early. As the trading day unfolds, the SPY (gray) is moving higher and the stock can’t get off the deck. That is a sign of relative weakness. It is making lower highs, but there are many mixed overlapping candles. This is not the relentless selling we want to see. Even with the market moving higher, the stock should move lower with ease. Remember, we want sellers to pound every bid and they need to express an urgency to get out of the stock. We want the stock to be oblivious to the market and we don’t have that here. Yes, there was an opportunity to short the new low for the day (dotted line), but the profits were marginal. There were warning signs that much of the move lower was exhausted so we should be ready to take gains near the low of the day. The market was moving lower in the middle of the day and the stock was finding support. </p>

<p>Let’s look at some recent earnings charts that set up for potential day trades right after the number. These are D1 charts and they are examples of trades that performed well. You can tell that because the candles were long and they closed near the high/low of the day. They had all of the characteristics we look for.</p>

<p>Earnings reports provide traders and investors with an opportunity to gauge the company’s recent performance and they provide us with a glimpse of the quarter ahead. Analysts are constantly updating their forecasts and the actual performance is typically close to what was expected. Stocks move after the earnings announcement, but massive moves through key technical levels are the exception and not the rule.</p>
<p>Our best opportunities come when the stock “surprises” analysts. If the stock is moving higher, we want to sense that long-term buyers are lined up and that they will buy every “ask” in sight. The stock will have incredible relative strength and it will be oblivious to any market dip. These buyers don’t care what the market is doing intraday, they want to buy this stock and hold it for a year or two. We want to see these stocks blow through every resistance level with nothing but “blue sky” ahead. If the stock gaps down, we want it to obliterate all support. The news was so disappointing that anyone holding shares will want to dump them. They will hit every bid because the longer-term prospects for the company are poor. The stock is below all major support levels and it has lots of room to fall. These earnings reactions set-up well for day trading. Be very selective and don’t compromise. </p>
