<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Low priced stocks can make big percentage moves in a short period of time and they lure traders in.</h4>
<p>Let’s start by defining small capitalization stocks. There is no hard set rule for this, but if the shares outstanding multiplied by the share price equals less than a billion dollars, it is a small cap stock in my opinion. In general, the stock price will be less than $10 and it will have a 20-day average volume of less than 1 million shares. These companies are often start ups and they are focused on growth. They typically don’t have “proof of concept”, “critical mass”, net income or cash reserves. In some instances, they don’t even have a product or generate revenues. A biotech start up would be an example. Analysts will monitor the “burn rate” closely since it measures how much cash the company has and how quickly the company is depleting it. At some point, they will have to issue more shares (dilutive) to keep the doors open and their ability to do so will reflect how institutions feel about the company’s business model and management. Start ups are often walking a tight rope and one missed step can spell disaster. Some of them reach milestones along the way that increase their odds of making it to the other side and during these moments the stock price shoots higher. </p>
<p>Large institutions don’t trade these stocks. They might take a long term stake in the company, but they are not trading shares.</p>
<p>Fundamental research is critically important because the company is fighting for survival. As with every investment/trade, risk and reward go hand in hand. You know from my previous articles that I feel retail traders are at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental research. Large institutions spend billions of dollars a year on research. Their analysts are invited to meet with corporate executives and they discuss recent developments and the future prospects for the company. Small cap companies might need to raise money for R&amp;D or plant and equipment in the future so they want to foster these relationships. The analysts ask very probing questions because they are trying to asses the company’s valuation. They’ve typically worked in the industry so their insights are keen. Analysts also conduct their own research. They meet with competitors and suppliers, and they know the regulatory hurdles. You should expect that you will always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental research. </p>
<p>Micro cap start ups don’t even get this level of scrutiny from large institutions. They are simply too small and it is not worthwhile for a large institution to dedicate resources to it. Private equity firms might take a stake in start-ups, but they spread their risk out across many companies knowing that the failure rate is high. They are also actively involved in managing the company and they have seats on the board. The research on these companies is tightly controlled and the institutions don’t share it.</p>
<p>From a swing trading standpoint, I am at a fundamental disadvantage. There isn’t much in the way of news so it is hard to stay informed. When there is an important development, the stock crashes or it shoots higher without warning. Small capitalization stocks present high risk and high potential reward for this reason. </p>
<p>From a technical perspective, small cap stocks sit idle for many months and all of a sudden the stock rockets higher. It breaks through technical resistance levels on heavy volume and the stock hits everyone’s radar. Novice traders with small accounts have visions of grandeur. “This stock is up 100% today. If I get one more day like this, I can double my money.” They check the news and of course it will sound incredible. Novices have no concept of valuation and they pile in. The can buy a lot of shares because these stocks are typically less than $10.</p>
<p>Large institutions make markets in these stocks. When there is no buyer, they will provide a bid. When there is no seller, they will provide an ask. Their role is to be the buyer or seller of last resort and the function is automated. The goal is to buy bids, sell asks and to be as “flat” as possible. Think of them as a “bookie” and the bid/ask spread is the “vig”. These algorithms run on massive servers. They know the patterns of institutional traders and retail traders. If you know who’s on the other side, you also know their staying power. Retail traders like “FOMO Joe” have very little staying power. He’s not focused on how much he can lose, he’s only focused on how much he is going to make. One fast drop will bring him back to reality and he will get flushed out for a loss. When a stock gets “hot”, the Market Makers widen the bid/ask spread (the “vig” just got bigger) and it is more difficult for the retail trader to get in and out. There is tremendous money to be made as a Market Maker in stocks and there is an incredible amount of information in that order flow. They have that information and you don’t. That is why large market making institutions pay brokerage firms for their order flow (your orders are routed to these market making firms). The broker uses that income to lower your commissions and to attract more accounts. This is how brokerage firms offer commission-free trading. Look at the income statement for Charles Schwab and you will see the revenues they generate from payment for order flow. </p>
<p>Let’s do a quick recap because it will help us to understand what is happening and then we can take this to the next level. These are start up companies that do not have a large institutional following. They can’t get any size off so there’s no reason for them to dedicate analysts to the company. At some point that could change, but only when the market cap has increased and the business model has been validated. That could take many years and it might not ever happen. So the only institutional involvement is only on the market making side. They know the nature of the stock (small cap) and the nature of the order flow (small retail orders). If they are buying, the market making algorithm will keep raising the ask price. The stock will start hitting searches and that will attract even more retail traders. The institution could be losing money on the way up, but they are not concerned at all. They have billions of dollars of capital and they are making markets on thousands of stocks. They know these are “weak hands” and some of them might be using 4:1 day trading leverage so the buyers have zero staying power. I suspect the market making algorithms can detect what the other market makers are doing and they often move in tandem. All they have to do is to drop the bid $.10 on a $5 stock. All of a sudden the trader wonders what happened. Some retail traders hit the panic button and they will start to sell. The algos drop the bid again and that prompts more selling. In a matter of minutes, the stock has a dramatic drop and retail traders are left with huge losses. Some of them will take painful losses and others will start to do fundamental analysis so that they can justify hanging on to this loser. Often the stock will retrace substantially and it will be dormant for many months. This ties up the trader’s capital and the position is a constant reminder of a very poor trading decision. Eventually, they take the loss. </p>
<p>The stock in the example below is “going to the moon”… literally. The company got a NASA contract worth a potential $5 billion. Is this material for the company? Heck yes, it adds legitimacy to it, not to mention the potential profits for the company. How may years is this contract spread over? How much will it cost the company to fulfill its obligations? Does this increase the company’s value by 50% overnight? “FOMO Joe” doesn’t know the answers to these questions. It all sounds great and the stock is breaking through technical resistance so he piles in. The stock drops 10% from his entry point so he has doubts and he takes the loss. Then the stock shoots right back to the high of the day and he thinks what a fool he was to bail on the trade. He buys it again and he is not going to get head faked out this time. The stock retreats the rest of the day and he takes a big loss. There are even more dramatic examples that I could have provided with monster swings in the stock during the day. Biotech stocks are known for this type of price action. The point is that you don’t know how to value the news. Others always have better information than you do. You are trading against the market makers algos so you had better know what you are doing.</p>

<p>Does this mean that you should never trade a small cap stock? For novice traders… yes. Professional traders will know legitimate news from “fluff”. If the move in the stock is the result of something that will materially change the company, they will know the nature of the news. Pros also know based on the price action and the volume if the move is legitimate. They know the “nature of the beast” and they will not be the last person standing when the music stops. They will buy dips and sell rips. Pros will not be greedy. They will take a piece of the move and they won’t think twice about what happens afterwards. </p>
<p>I don’t trade these stocks so I am not going to spend a lot of time on the analysis. If a Pro is trading a stock that has gone parabolic, they will not wait for the climax. They will take big gains along the way and they will scale out on long green candles. They will set targets well above the current price when the stock is still shooting higher and they will make “FOMO Joe” reach for their orders. They know it is just a matter of time until the rug gets pulled out and they plan to be out well before everyone else heads for the exit. Pros will avoid trading garbage like the second chart below and they will favor the third chart below. </p>

<p>I haven’t talked about shorting low cap stocks. First of all, they are very hard to borrow (not available for shorting). If the stock drops 10% or more, the uptick rule is triggered. That means you can’t hit bids and your offer has to be higher than the highest bid. This is also known as the short sale restriction (SSR). Perhaps the biggest reason not to short is that these stocks are not liquid and you are vulnerable to a massive short squeeze. The odds of this are greater when the stock has already plunged. If you are shorting a stock that ran higher and that is cresting, you’d better know what you are doing. Some of these breakouts will be legitimate and your potential losses are unlimited. If you short low cap stocks overnight, brokerage firms charge high interest rates on hard to borrow stocks and that will make it harder to make money. </p>
<p>There are many “gurus” that claim that big gains can be made trading small cap momentum stocks. Remember that risk and reward always go hand in hand. You are trading against market making algos that evaluate the order flow and that know how to manipulate price. The price action is volatile and the bid/ask spreads are wide. This is an arena for seasoned Pros and I would discourage most traders from attempting it.</p>
<p>Focus on medium and large cap stocks where the information is plentiful, the bid/ask spreads are tight and the price action is orderly. </p>
