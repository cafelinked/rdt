<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure all of the checkboxes marked, there might be some that you’ve missed. Until you have your win rate above 75%, buy dips and not breakouts. Here’s why.</h4>
<p>A question came up in the chat room Friday and it is a good one. “<em>I had a strong D1 breakout and a good M5 so I bought the stock for a day trade. It pulled back during the day. Do I stick with the position and lean on the D1 chart and make it a swing trade or should I take the loss on the day trade?”</em>&nbsp;Does this dilemma sound familiar? There are many moving parts to the answer so I will try to hit them.</p>
<p>Your decision to take a day trade or a swing trade is based on your market analysis and your confidence in that analysis. The same holds true for the stock on a D1 basis and an M5 basis. Your percentage of day trades that turn into swing trades should be very small (&lt; 5%). If that number is higher, you are making poor trading decisions and you need to work on your entry. The only reason you are “holding the bag” is because you entered poorly and the stock instantly went against you. If your entry was good and the stock took off, you would set your stop above your entry price and manage the gains. When this happens, I don’t get this question. So let’s address the problem.</p>
<p>My first suggestion is that if your win rate is less than 75%, you should work on that first. When you are day trading you need to have that fantastic D1 and M5 chart. Look for technical breakouts, relative strength, heavy volume, stacked consecutive green candles, no nearby resistance, nice orderly price action… you know the drill. Even then, you should not buy breakouts near the high of the day. Set multiple alerts below the current price. When the alerts are triggered, what did the pullback look like? Was it brief, shallow and unorganized where the VWAP held? Did that dip coincide with a market dip where the stock actually held strong? If yes, this is going to be a good candidate for a day trading long. If the pullback has stacked red candles and it is organized, it has more downside. Set additional alerts at lower prices. Each time an alert is triggered, check the price action. If all of the alerts are triggered and the stock has a big pullback, you need to do more work on your D1 and M5 analysis. You missed something and your stock selection is poor. Big pullbacks in longs you are considering should not happen often (when the market is stable). If the dip is reasonable and it is above the VWAP, when the stock finds support, set upside alerts and buy when they are triggered. This will force you to buy dips and you can evaluate the stock’s strength/weakness during the pullback. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a platform feature that automates this process and that generates an alert?</p>
<p><em>“But Pete, if I wait for dips, sometimes I miss great stock moves.”</em>&nbsp;That is true, but you will also avoid having the rug pulled out from under you and you will avoid the overnight risk of holding a “day trade gone bad”. Here’s the deal, if you have a win rate that is greater than 75%, you can buy all of the day trading breakouts to a new high of the day that you want. You have the skills to distinguish good breakouts from bad ones. Those trades carry higher risk and reward. To the novice trader, every breakout looks the same, but they are not. If you have ever watched Hari trade real-time, he is like Tom Brady surveying the field and making a throw two seconds after the snap. He has the awareness to digest all of the information real-time. This skill comes from experience and you are not there… yet.</p>
<p>So let’s look at couple of stocks and let’s look at some charts. These are the things you need to be aware of. First of all, market first. I don’t want to get heavy into the market analysis, but this is the cornerstone. The backdrop was that the SPY bounced off of the 200-day MA Thursday. It closed on its high and above the 50-day MA. The market gapped up Friday and it held the gap during the first hour of trading. We have a bullish backdrop for day trading!!! Again, if we had market chop and an “inside” light volume day, we would have to adjust our game plan. Friday we were in buying mode. This is a very important first step. Armed with a bullish market bias we need to find strong stocks to day trade.</p>
<p>You start searching for stocks and … oh baby did I find a nice one! This stock has a great D1. It is above all of the major moving averages so it is fairly strong, it is breaking out through multiple trendlines, it has relative strength and the volume has been pretty decent. The M5 looks great too. It filled the overnight gap and bounced, it is above the prior day’s high, it has relative strength, the volume is heavy and it is stacking green candles. It marks all of the checkboxes – BUY!</p>

<p>Now you are long the stock. You start thinking,&nbsp;<em>“This is going to be a great day trade. Look at that relative strength M5 and that heavy volume. I also have a market tailwind.”</em>&nbsp;A few minutes later you are swearing up a storm and thinking,&nbsp;<em>“This system sucks.”</em>&nbsp;Trust me, it doesn’t. You missed some important clues. You do not yet have the skills needed to pick up on all of the nuances of price action. That is why you need to buy dips and set alerts. The dotted lines in the chart below are where I would place alerts. You want the open from those long green candles to hold. When they are violated with ease (a bar or two later), that is a warning that the stock is not that strong. When the stock gives back all of its gains and all of your alerts have been triggered it is weak and you should look for a stock that has better strength. Here are some of the clues you should have picked up on and missed.</p>

<p>The clues were that the D1 chart for AMR and it is a turbulent as a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt. It has mixed overlapping candles with tons of retracement. Consequently, this is not a strong trend. The technical breakout is nice, but it has to get through multiple trendlines. The overnight gap fill,&nbsp;<em>“What the hell was that all about?”</em>&nbsp;You realize,&nbsp;<em>“The market rallied the day before and AMR barley made a gain. There should not be a bid check.”</em>&nbsp;The market was strong. If buyers were lined up for AMR, there never would have been a gap fill and the stock would have been climbing from the open. Intraday gaps are not common.&nbsp;<em>What the hell was that?</em>&nbsp;Heavy volume and stacked green candles. We look for this, but why would I need to rush in and buy a stock like AMR?&nbsp;<em>“Did they discover a new peanut that will make them the preferred airline?”</em>&nbsp;Of course not, this stock is choppy as heck and the “seasoned eye” knows this. The novice checks what they think are all of the boxes. They buy the high of the day, the bottom drops out and then they complain that this system does not work and that they do not “get it”. By the way, the stock did recover and it did eventually make a new high of the day. “Bag holders” rejoice and the lesson they learned is,&nbsp;<em>“I just have to weather some storms and stick to my guns”</em>. That is one of many lessons.</p>
<p>So let’s find a nice example of where you would buy a breakout to a new high. Again, remember you had an excellent market backdrop Friday so that makes this entry viable. We do not always have that. This stock is a good pick for buying a breakout. WYNN has a super strong D1 chart and it is well above all of the major MAs. It has been moving higher during a market drop the last few weeks (relative strength). It had a post earnings breakout to a new relative high. Market weakness kept a lid on it, but buyers were interested at the breakout so it held. The stock bounced while the market was weak and it broke out (bull flag). It broke out through two additional D1 trendlines on heavy volume. The price action has been very orderly. That is a sign that buyers are engaged. The stock can’t pullback because any selling is instantly gobbled up (tiny dips). The price action Thursday was very steady (super tight and orderly). It got a little ahead of itself Thursday and there was a little profit taking near the end of the day (nothing too dramatic, just gave back late gains). Friday the market was strong. The stock has nice gains in the last week and sellers were going to test the bid. That took place in the first hour and the bid held. In this case, the gap fill was fine. WYNN had big gains previously. WYNN buyers were still there. The stock regained its footing and it rallied above the prior day’s high and it broke a small M5 down trendline. It had relative strength. You would buy some here and add on follow through. You don’t have to enter the trade all at once – scale in on confirmation. The volume picked up after the new high of the day and it was better than average the rest of the day (confirmation of trend strength).</p>

<p>“But Pete, you are cherry-picking examples.” Hell yes I am. That is what you have to do every day. Pick the best stocks. What just took me 4 hours to write and annotate I can do in about 5 seconds of chart reading.</p>
<p>The market is different every day. If it opens inside of the prior day’s range on light volume, you do not have the same backdrop. If it opens outside of that range and the volume is heavy, you have a good market backdrop. If the market has a strong D1 trend and stacked M5 candles, great. Then we have the right ingredients to buy breakouts. Then it is time to find the&nbsp;<strong>best</strong>&nbsp;stock.</p>
