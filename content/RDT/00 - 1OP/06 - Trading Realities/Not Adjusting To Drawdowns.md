<h4 class="wp-block-heading">We need to reduce our trading activity when our performance declines. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>We’ve discussed the concept of market cycles. There will be times when the best trade… is no trade. As much as we want to make money every day, the market is not always going to provide us with the high odds set-ups we need. Traders will often force bad trades and they will lose money. Novice traders who try to make money before they are ready will get the market or the stock wrong. They will lose money because they are making poor decisions. Professional traders will sometimes get caught on the wrong side of a move, but they recognize that quickly and they adjust immediately. There’s new information and they know that whatever they lost, they will quickly make back based on this new information. No matter what the reason, we need to reduce our activity and we need to identify the source of the problem. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What_s_The_Market_Doing_">What’s The Market Doing?</h2>
<p>The trader who hits a really nice market trend will finally think that they have “figured it out.” Now they just have to repeat this every day. They start extrapolating gains out into the future and they have visions of grandeur. Soon after, they start “leaking oil” and they give everything back. If you find yourself in this situation, stop trading. Something has changed and you are going to keep digging a deeper hole if you don’t find the source of the problem. Chances are you are either not predicting the market well or you are not selecting good stocks. Conditions have changed and the market uptrend is not as strong. </p>
<p>You could be out of sync with the market. If it is in a choppy stair-step pattern higher, you are buying horizontal breakouts to a new relative high. Those moves don’t have much more upside and you overstay your welcome. Just as the position starts to produce nice gains, it reverses and you are stuck with a loss. Your approach should be to buy dips once support is established and to add on confirmation. This would be a tactic to use when you have an upward sloping trading channel. That lower trendline is where you want to be buying. When the market rally breaks through horizontal resistance, you are waiting for signs that the move is stalling out and you are taking gains into strength. Use the upper trendline as a guide. You might also be forcing trades in a low probability environment. If the market has been trending nicely, you might not be picking the best stocks. They need to have strong trends, nice orderly price action, heavy volume, relative strength and technical breakouts. Don’t chase the stock if it is too far away from the EMA 8. Use alerts to buy dips. These are only a few examples of what might be going wrong with your trades. The point is to stop trading. Go back and analyze every market day and every trade. Write extensive logs. This is where you will find your answers. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Take_A_Step_Back">Take A Step Back</h2>
<p>When you take a step back from trading, you will immediately take some of the pressure off of your performance. You aren’t trading so you are not expecting to make money. Know that you will find the answer and that your trading will improve. You should watch as many trades go by as possible before you take one. That could mean that you don’t trade for days. Some of those trades will be winners and some of those trades will be losers. You tell yourself that you only have one bullet and that your life depends on it finding its mark. Your trade logs will reveal solutions and you will start to regain your confidence without even placing a trade. You will settle down mentally. Eventually, you will see a trade where everything lines up. All of the checkboxes are marked and your confidence is sky high. You can’t resist taking this trade. You’ve waited patiently, so you enter it. Low and behold, it is a winner. </p>
<p>Now you have to think about all of the reasons why that trade worked out and why your confidence was so high. Typically, you will find that you were muddling around in a sideways market and that you needed to be more patient. You needed to “right this ship” so you focused on the best of the best and you waited for the market and the stock to set up. Your odds of success were high and you knew it. Now, imagine removing all of the marginal trades you have taken and only focusing on trades like the one you just completed. You’ve been humbled and it is time to “get back on the horse.” Work your way back gradually. </p>
<p>The novice trader who is not ready to trade piles right in. They take a beating and they instantly go into revenge trading mode. That’s where they get into a mindset that they are going to make that money back and that they “figured this out.” These traders will also average down. They were wrong on the market and/or the stock initially. Instead of admitting that, they stick with their original thesis. They keep adding to a losing position and they can’t admit that they are wrong. The stock could be falling below every major support level, but they continue to add. Their average cost is higher than the current price so they are losing money. Every time they look at their account they are an emotional train wreck. Eventually, they can’t stand looking at it and they take a huge loss. They don’t pause, they just keep adding to the problem. Learning how to trade takes a lot of time. There are no short cuts and they have much to learn. Most of these traders will never trade again. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Do_Pros_Lose_">Do Pros Lose?</h2>
<p>Pros are not immune to losses. They’ve gone through this process many times and they know where the problem resides even as it is unfolding. Typically, it is because their thesis was flawed or because they were blindsided by news that could not have been anticipated. It could be that the market is transitioning. Perhaps a trend reversal is looming. In these instances, they need to curb their trading and they need to focus on what has them in a funk. If the losses were due to new information, there will be more opportunities trading in the opposite direction. Their thesis will change and the money they lost will quickly be made back and then some. </p>
<p>Pros can get over-confident. My biggest losses have always followed my biggest gains and I figured out long ago that it was prudent to take money out of the account after a big run. The account is still bigger than it was before the run, but this reminds me to make good trading decisions and not to get sloppy. This prevents me from going into a losing streak because I am throttling back before I reach that point.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Curb_Your_Trading">Curb Your Trading</h2>
<p>Regardless of the reasons, you’ve gone through a drawdown. This is not a time to ramp up, this is a time to curb your trading. You need to find the source of the issue and you need to figure out how to correct it. Extensive analysis of each trade will reveal the issue and you need to write about it in your trade logs so that the lesson is not lost. Stop the bleeding and do not dig a deeper hole. When it is time to start back up, be as patient as ever. Let scores of trades go by and wait for that “can’t miss” opportunity. Your next trade has to be a winner and your career depends on it. This is the mindset you need to adopt. When you exit that trade, it is likely to be a winner. Note everything that took place. This is the blue print for all of your future trades. All of the checkboxes have to be marked and you are only going to trade the best of the best.</p>
