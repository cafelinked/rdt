<p>There’s a reason why everything I teach starts with – MARKET FIRST. It is the single most important influence on your success and I believe it is 65% of the puzzle. Yes, getting market direction is critically important, but sometimes there is no market direction and that is equally important to recognize. Let me provide you with some examples.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Pre_Covid_19">Pre Covid-19</h2>
<p>Before Covid-19, the Fed was in money printing mode and they were supporting a 0% interest rate policy (ZIRP). Bonds were not yielding any return so you had to own stocks. That provided a safety net and the market was in a steady float higher. The intraday ranges were minuscule and it was almost impossible to make money day trading. Sure, there were strong stocks that we could trade, but you had to have longer term swing exposure. The majority of the moves came overnight and swing trades were the money makers. If you only day traded, you went hungry and you forced trades. Your focus had to be on swing trades.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo_">2021</h2>
<p>At the end of 2021, we recognized that the rally was running out of steam. The typical year-end rally did not materialize. During a time when we don’t normally see dips, we were seeing many. In fact, dips in the prior year had been very minor and we would rarely visit the 50-day MA. That year-end price action was a clear sign that conditions were changing. The first step was to trim long swing exposure and to go to cash. In January and February of 2022, we started to see technical confirmation that we were headed into a bear market. The intraday ranges were gigantic. In the early stages of a bear market, the bid will remain stubborn. Sellers will be aggressive and buyers who were trained to buy dips the last decade are still engaged. We had massive reversals from one day to the next. This was a day trader’s dream. The moves were so big that I could not justify taking overnight risk, I didn’t need to. Swing trading was almost impossible. What looked good one day (or one week) looked horrible the next.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo__2">2022</h2>
<p>In 2022, if you strip out the high from August and the low from October, the market is in a fairly wide range from $375 to $415. We are not seeing those giant drops and rebounds. From it’s peak a year earlier, the 20-day ATR has fallen from $11 to $6 on the SPY. This is a sign that the ranges are collapsing and we are not seeing the type of volatility we had 8 months ago. The SPY also has a higher low double bottom, it has broken the down trend that started in January 2022, it is above all of the major MAs and we have a “Golden Cross.”</p>

<p>“Does this mean we are off to the races?” No! There are still plenty of dark clouds on the horizon. The Fed will continue to hike, inflation is still “hot,” valuations are still rich, the yield curve is inverted and the economy is likely to contract. Cool. “Does that mean the market is going to hell in a handbasket?” No. Trillions of dollars (record levels) of cash are sitting on the sidelines and I believe some of that is being put to work right now. That explains why the market has been able to shoulder all of the bad headlines. Asset Managers only care if the market is higher than this level a year from now. If they feel that is likely, they will buy dips.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Ignore_The_Headlines">Ignore The Headlines</h2>
<p>I mention the fundamental backdrop, but I did not start making serious money trading until I erased all of that MBA crap from my brain. If you think you are smart, do yourself a favor and ignore the headlines. Don’t try to rationalize “good news is bad news” and do not try to explain every wiggle and jiggle with some headline. Let the talking heads on CNBC do that. Instead, realize that you do not know shit about fundamental analysis and that price is all you need. Price is truth.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the market was in a D1 wedge formation. We had the FOMC, earnings from AAPL, GOOG and AMZN and the jobs report all in a 3 day span. Surely, this was going to spark a breakout in one direction or the other. Since those releases, the market has not done “Jack.” Where have we gone? Nowhere! This price action is sending us a clear message. We are in a stalemate. Buyers and sellers are paired off. These are the signs you need to be picking up on.</p>

<p>Bear markets do not always have a “V” bottom. During the financial crisis, there was the threat of a financial collapse. Stocks retreated farther than anyone expected and the threat was real. When that threat passed, we had a huge rebound. In 2019, we had never seen anything like Covid-19. It was a global pandemic. People were dying and the whole world shut down. That drop was severe (some of that drop was caused by over-exposure to the long side because of ZIRP, no hedges and a crowded short volatility trade) and the low came quickly after a couple of months of selling. Those are the most recent bear markets, so those are the ones we remember. Many bear markets transition from a down trend to a horizontal trading range. Yes we will move within that range and we should expect that. In time, the Fed will stop hiking, inflation will subside and companies will grow into their valuations. I believe we are transitioning right now, and we can see that in the wide range from 2022 and the wedge in the chart above.</p>

<p>If you are a day trader, you have the screen time to do swing trading research. I believe that day trading is much harder than swing trading because it requires precision. The same skills you have developed as a day trader (the same patterns, risk management and concepts) can be transferred over to swing trading. The only difference is that you have to get used to taking overnight risk. Like everything, start small and get used to it. For some of you, this will come as a relief because you will not be forced to day trade. You won’t be handcuffed by PDT and you won’t have to worry about monster overnight reversals.</p>
<p>If you are going to be a successful trader, you have to be able to adapt to changing market conditions. If you are only day trading, you are going to find that the things that worked a few months ago are not working. When we string a number of tight “Inside Days” together, you are going to force bad trades. Having some swing trades will take some of the pressure off and they will generate nice income for you.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Basic_Options_Strategies">Basic Options Strategies</h2>
<p>I am going to suggest two very basic swing trading options strategies that you can use. One is selling naked puts on stocks that you want to own and I provided an example in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFloiAALJS0&amp;t=261s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video I recorded today</a>. The other is selling OTM vertical credit spreads. These are generally neutral, but you can add a bullish bias (bullish put spread) or a bearish bias (bearish call spread) to reflect your market opinion. If you are unfamiliar with these strategies, you can learn more about them on my channel or through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.optionseducation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Options Industry Council’s</a>&nbsp;website. This is a great free resource.</p>
<p>I hope my article encourages you to start adding some swing trades to your game plan. Conditions are changing – MARKET FIRST! Trade well. </p>
