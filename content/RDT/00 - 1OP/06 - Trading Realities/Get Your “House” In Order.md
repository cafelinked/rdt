<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If your life is filled with stress, trading well will be extremely difficult. You need to address the source of that stress and remove it or wait for it to pass. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>This is going to be a relatively short article, but it is an important one. When our mind is preoccupied with other things in our life, we are not fully focused on trading. This profession is filled with ups and downs and we can deal with them when we are on top of our game. When your life is “upside down,” you will be an emotional train wreck and you will make poor decisions. At a moment’s notice, your trading day could be disrupted. You won’t be able to manage your positions and when they are on “auto pilot,” your risk of a bad outcome is high. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Health">Health</h2>
<p>If your physical health is poor, take care of yourself. Get the treatment or the therapy you need and give yourself time to heal. The same is true for your mental health. Trying to trade when you are not “right” mentally is like throwing gasoline on a fire. If you struggle with dependency issues, address those immediately. You need to have a “clear” mind to trade and awareness is one of the keys to success. You will not be alert and you will make bad decisions. This is why casinos offer free cocktails when you are gambling. “Sound body, sound mind.” To trade successfully, you need to be at your best. The market will always be there for you. Get yourself well. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Primary_Caregivers">Primary Caregivers</h2>
<p>If a family member is ill, spend time with them and help them get better. If you are the primary caregiver, your attention will be divided. You will be physically and mentally exhausted and you will be prone to making bad decisions. “I don’t have a lot of time to trade today so I need to find some good picks in less than an hour and hope for the best.” You do not want to force trades when you are in this mode. You will become frustrated by your role as a primary care giver because it is robbing you from your normal activities. Your trades will suffer and it will impact your relationship with the loved one you are taking care of. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day_Job">Day Job</h2>
<p>If your job keeps you busy during the day, focus on long-term swing trades. Don’t try to day trade between meetings. You won’t trade well and you will not perform your job well. If you hate your boss and your job, trading while you are at work is not the solution. Find a new job where you can work when the market is closed or change to another shift. If trading is your passion, you will be able to focus on it during the day. Changing jobs is a big “ask,” but it’s what you have to do if trading is your passion.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Debt">Debt</h2>
<p>If you are deeply in debt, you are not going to trade your way out of it. “Scared money never wins” and you will find yourself in an even deeper hole. You will not have any staying power and you will be a nervous wreck. You need this money and you can’t afford to lose a dime of it.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Rocky_Relationships">Rocky Relationships</h2>
<p>If you are married and your relationship is “on the rocks,” it is going to add incredible stress to your life. Your relationship is probably the only thing you are thinking about. You will be trying to trade, but your mind will be elsewhere. Let these “seas” calm before you resume trading. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Suboptimal_Conditions">Suboptimal Conditions</h2>
<p>Home remodeling, natural disasters and moving to a new residence are all stressful periods in our lives. Your “trading cave” has been uprooted. This is where you get into “the zone.” Your lights, your monitors, and your layouts are perfect. In any other environment, you will be like a fish out of water. In time, you will be back in your space and then you can resume trading. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The_Market_Will_Always_Be_There">The Market Will Always Be There</h2>
<p>I’ve either dealt with these issues personally or I’ve talked to traders who have been affected by them. You will not be at your best and you need to be. The margin for error in trading is slim and waiting for these clouds to part is important. I’ve made poor trading decisions when my personal life was filled with stress and they were very costly. I learned to stop trading during these periods the hard way. Get your “house” in order and now that the market will still be there when you are ready.</p>
