<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The market gives us signs that conditions are changing. Traders who are oblivious to these “tells” will be caught off guard and they will be humbled. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>The market is always processing new information that might impact earnings, interest rates or economic growth. Buyers and sellers will adjust their forecasts and their risk exposure to stocks. It is important to know the macro forces that are currently driving the market, but you don’t have to become an economist. Read the market headlines and conduct basic fundamental analysis and you will know all that you need. We leave the heavy lifting for the institutions and when they are buying or selling, they leave a trail of bread crumbs. Price action tells us what they are doing. </p>
<p>Market First! Traders who are oblivious to this important concept will continue to trade just as they have been. They don’t adjust their risk or their strategies and they are blind-sided. They can’t figure out what changed, they just know that they are losing money. By the time they realize what’s happening, it’s too late. In this article, I am going to talk about a few different types of transitions and how you need to trade each of them. These are difficult periods to trade and they require some mental adjustment. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identifying_Transitions">Identifying Transitions</h2>
<p>Let’s start with everyone’s favorite type of transition. We don’t often get trend reversals from a bear market to a bull market. They are powerful and they are emotionally uplifting. The reason why we don’t get many of these set-ups is apparent when you look at a 50-year chart of the S&amp;P 500 below. Bear markets are not common. They last less than two years on average. Typically, people are laid off and the mood is very somber during a bear market. When conditions start to change, there is light at the end of the tunnel. When the bear market ends, there will be an incredible opportunity to “buy low” and to join that 50-year up trend. Asset Managers are aggressively buying and the trend during the initial stages of the rebound is very strong and predictable. As traders, this is when we need to be aggressive. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Types_Of_Bear_Markets">Types Of Bear Markets</h2>
<p>There are two types of bear markets. One is credit related and it is surrounded by uncertainty. The financial crisis in 2008 and the Covid-19 crash of 2020 are two examples of events that sparked panic. In these instances, fear sets in and the selling is relentless. The smart money is “running for cover” and they wonder, “Could this be the big one?” Retail investors are in panic mode and the world seems like it is falling apart. The major media outlets “fan the flames.” Bad news sells and they will “guide you through these stormy seas” – not. When I speak of uncertainty, I mean it in the most dire sense. “Will the entire financial system collapse?” “Will there be a run on the banks?” “How many people will die from Covid-19?” “Will this cause a financial collapse?” <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/long-term-fundamental/credit/">Credit</a> is the common theme to big market drops and I wrote about it in the market fundamentals section. It is the one concern that can produce panic at every level – even institutions. That type of heavy selling pressure results in a very deep low. We call that a capitulation low and it forms a “V” bottom. This transition is fairly easy for traders to manage because you shift instantly from bearish to bullish. Long red D1 candles are erased by long green bullish engulfing candles. The low is in and it is time to buy. The journey to that low is gut wrenching. Remember, we are not bottom pickers! We need that capitulation low an it needs to be swift and very deep. This is NOT a market that is just drifting lower, the bottom has fallen out! There is blood in the streets! We don’t see this set up often, but it is an over-reaction. We need those long green candles that blow through the open of the previous long red candle on the bounce. Then we know the low is in and then we can expect a “V” bottom recovery. This transition is fairly rare so I am not going to spend a lot of time on it. When you get these incredibly deep and fast market drops, the VIX/VXX will skyrocket. The world is falling apart! When you get that first bullish engulfing candle off of the low or that first bullish hammer with a very long tail, exit all of your bearish positions. If you are long put options, sell them. The option IVs will be extremely high and they are about to collapse. If you are an option trader, you want to be a put seller once the low is in. You want to sell those expensive IVs. You can sell naked puts, but your upside will be limited to the premium you collected. There will be longer-term plays and this will be a longer-term low. I suggest selling ATM bullish put spreads and buying OTM bullish call spreads with 3+ months until expiration. The height of the bounce will be very tall. You are selling expensive put options and you are buying expensive call options from an IV standpoint. If you are only buying longer-term options, you will only be buying expensive calls and you want to defray that cost. I will discuss this in greater detail in the options section. If you don’t trade options, start buying stocks and plan to buy on margin. You want that exposure. As you know from my previous articles, never, never, never average down during the drop. It will be deeper than you could have ever expected and it will last longer than you could have ever imagined. This will mentally destroy you. You have to wait for that low (stacked red candles) and that super long green candle. Buy and add on confirmation (higher lows). </p>

<p>There are more common bear markets that have a gradual decline. There is not any “panic in the street.” In 2001, the issue was extreme valuations after the “.com bubble.” Valuations were too high. During the initial stages of the market decline, the move was swift. Valuations don’t cause panic, sooner or later, buyers will find these stocks to be “attractive.” We just have to wait for signs that support is forming. I started trading in 2002 and this was the most difficult market environment I’ve traded. Stocks were ticking lower and then a spike out of nowhere would destroy bearish swing positions. The US was preparing to invade Iraq and that added to the uncertainty. I didn’t know how to trade this environment and I was losing money. In April 2003, the US invaded Iraq, the market bounced and my trading turned around quickly. For those of you who were trading in 2022, you experienced difficult market conditions that were similar. This was a bottoming process filled with big drops and big bounces. The Federal Reserve launched its most aggressive tightening cycle ever and they hiked interest rates by 4% in a year to combat the highest inflation in decades. Institutions suspected that economic activity would implode, but it didn’t. The market move lower was very choppy and the odds that this tightening cycle could spark credit issues remained fairly low during that year. When the low was in, the rebound was very gradual. This was a more difficult transition to trade and I will explain why. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo__Bear_Market">2022 Bear Market</h2>
<p>In 2022 we were in a bear market, but the bounces during the entire year were very tall. You can see that in the weekly chart above (right side). That was a sign that buyers were still engaged. When the low was established in October 2022, the rebound was also very choppy. Unlike the “V” bottom formation I described, this was more of a bowl shaped pattern. You couldn’t get aggressively long because the dips were deep. Mentally it was difficult to switch from focusing on the short side to focusing on the long side. We never had concrete evidence that economic conditions would not deteriorate after aggressive monetary tightening. Institutions kept expecting a recession and they kept pricing in a rate cut. Buyers and sellers were in a constant battle and over the course of a year, we learned that the US economy was strong enough to shoulder these rate hikes. As a trader in this environment, you were constantly looking over your shoulder and you were waiting for bad news that never comes. When the market is transitioning from bearish to bullish, the direction is uncertain. You can’t get aggressive with your trades. Mentally you are shifting from… “focus on shorts” to… “longs and shorts” to… focus on “longs.” Your trade duration is short-term and you are buying dips and exiting into strength. In the fall of 2023, the Federal Reserve stopped raising rates and that sparked a very steady market rally. The tight orderly price action you see at the far right of the chart below was a sign that a longer-term bullish trend was starting. Now we were finally in a “long only” environment where we could ride trades without the fear of a market drop. </p>
<p>According to Mark Twain, “If you have to eat a frog, it’s best to do it in the morning.” In other words, get it done quickly and don’t agonize over it. The same is true for market corrections. From a trading standpoint, the big fast drops are much easier to trade. The drops are deep and swift and the reversal is crisp and clean. As directional traders, we are active during strong trends and we have one on the way down and one on the way back up. When we have bear markets that meander lower, the trend is much weaker and so is the rebound. It is a bottoming process that eventually gains traction. The issues that lead to the bear market are gradually resolved over time. The steady rally that we had seen in the summer of 2023 told me that any drop would set up an incredible buying opportunity. In the middle of October, we were preparing for a fantastic buying opportunity and we got it. In the chart below, you can see the “V” bottom during the Covid-19 crash (left side) and the spike in option implied volatilities. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47dDPIZ7TKY&amp;t=736s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selling Naked Puts In A Market Crash</a> is a video I posted in March of 2020 and you can see how we were trading. All of the other videos from that point forward focused on aggressively trading the long side. In the spring of 2023, I was much more cautious than I was in 2020. This bear market did not have much of a selling climax. We had a couple of large bank failures and right when I was starting to get bullish in March of 2023, I decided to stay guarded. Having been through a financial crisis, there was smoke and I wanted to see if there was a fire. By the end of the summer (2023), I was confident that these were isolated banking instances. The next pullback would set up an excellent buying opportunity. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Fall_23_">Fall 23′</h2>
<p>The transition in the fall of 2023 was not an easy one for most traders. We had just endured a bear market and then prolonged, low probability choppy conditions. When the time came to enter longs aggressively and to ride them, many traders did what they had been doing for the last year. When they had nice profits, they took them. Unfortunately, the market kept going higher and they would have to re-enter at a higher price. They failed to recognize that the back drop had changed. There were no dips so there was no reason to worry. When the market continued higher, they took gains when they were “satisfied.” This is also not a legitimate trading approach. You take gains when the price action tells you to. Their tactic was more of a swing scalping approach. They made money, but not as much as they could have if they would have stayed the course and added to positions. It was very difficult mentally for them to shift gears because they had been “conditioned” to use a “hit and run” approach. The key was to recognize that the strength in the first half of 2023 would set up an excellent trading opportunity. Any dip was going to provide a fantastic entry for longer-term bullish swing trades and we would be able to ride them. The super tight price action in November and December and the lack of dips signaled strong trend strength and this was a move you could ride and add to. It’s hard to “flip the switch” from neutral to extremely bullish. It takes years of experience and a high level of confidence in your analysis to do it. This skill is where traders take their game to the next level. </p>

<p>So now we have a nice strong bull market. We are on “easy street” – right? Trading is tough… always. We have to constantly adapt and adjust. There are stretches where profits come easily, but they are few and far between. Most of these “runs” come off of trend reversals. We have to wait for the early signs that a reversal might be forming and we have to wait for technical confirmation. In the early stages of that trend reversal, the price action is very strong. I will admit that the bear market of 2022 was very challenging. The price action on the way down was very choppy and it remained that way during the rebound. Traders had to exercise a great deal of patience. This was an incredible learning environment and only those with discipline survived. When the tide finally shifted in the fall of 2023, traders made a lot of money. Their first reaction was, “So this is what it’s like to trade a bull market. This is like shooting fish in a barrel.” I know this from comments in my chat room and from comments in Reddit and Discord. Traders made a lot of money and they were able to ride trades for a much longer period of time. Most of them didn’t make as much as they should have on the way up because they were scalping in and out, but they did very well. They had very high win rates for a few months and this was a big emotional lift for them after a couple of challenging years. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="April_24_">April 24′</h2>
<p>Trading bullish markets is generally less difficult, but it is not easy. As I write this lesson, the market rally is starting to mature. The upward momentum is starting to stall and the price action is “loose.” We are seeing more red candles and small gaps up and down. The price action is not nearly as tight and orderly as it was and this is the time to take profits on longer-term swings. Big market moves need time to digest gains and strong trends typically transition into horizontal trading ranges. The long red bearish engulfing candle in the chart below was a warning sign and traders needed to adopt a neutral bias. You will only see a long red candle that is 200% of the average true range on very heavy volume if sellers are aggressive. If buyers were aggressive, the market would never have dropped like that. The fact that there were no major dips and no long red candles told us that buyers were aggressive and that we needed to favor the long side to that point. Now we have new information in the form of price action.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Evaluate_The_Dip">Evaluate The Dip</h2>
<p>As soon as the long red bearish engulfing candle surfaced (right side of chart above), we understood that intraday ranges would expand. How did we know that? First of all, the price action was starting to “loosen.” We no longer had a nice, tight, orderly march higher. The upward momentum had waned and we were seeing gaps up and down and more red candles. The market was trading in a horizontal range. Buyers and sellers were batting and that meant that both sides would be flexing their muscles. When one side was able to move the market, a nice intraday trend would result. When that move lost its momentum, we could expect that the other side was going to take their turn. This means that we focus more on day trading and a little less on swing trading. Given the recent trend strength, if the market did have a dip, it would be brief and shallow. Bull markets die hard and at very least, the market would bounce and it would make another effort at getting back to the high. This sets up well for selling out of the money bullish put spreads on strong stocks. This is a neutral to slightly bullish strategy. <strong>Stock traders needed to wait for a dip and they needed to wait for technical confirmation of support before buying.</strong> It is critically important that you understand the previous sentence. They should NOT simply expect that the market is going to breakout to a new all-time high. They needed more information to reach that conclusion and the dip would provide that. That long red candle off of the all-time high was massive and it is a sign of stiff resistance. A brief and shallow dip would be bullish and it would pave the way for a rally to the all-time high. They would hold positions if the market was able to blow through that horizontal resistance on the first attempt and if it approached that level with nice stacked green candles. Swing traders should take gains if the market shows resistance at the prior high, especially if it takes a long time for it to grind to that level and if the candles are mixed and overlapping (low quality bounce). We want to see a slingshot to a new all-time high. Anything less confirms resistance and selling pressure.</p>
<p>In the current environment, we are keeping our positions relatively small and the trade duration has been reduced. We are taking bullish and bearish positions on stocks that have relative strength and relative weakness respectively. Our market risk is reduced if we decide to take short-term overnight positions because we have a balance of longs and shorts. Our confidence on market direction is low at this juncture. We are clearly in a holding pattern and we are waiting for technical signs of a breakout one way or the other. </p>
<p>The long red engulfing candle tells me that there will be more selling pressure and to expect that dip. Buyers will be a bit more passive and this is the pullback they have been waiting for. The probe for support will be brief and shallow with mixed overlapping candles. Why? Because buyers will still be engaged. The 20% rally from November through February was not a fluke and that strong price action tells us that at very least, we will see one more move towards the all-time high. While I wait for this dip to unfold, I will keep my trade duration short-term and I keep my trades balanced. If I get this type of dip, it will tell me that buyers are still interested and that we should see an attempt to get through the all-time high. I am not guessing which outcome we will get. I am staying relatively neutral and I am waiting to see what happens. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SPY041524b-1.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="38935ca9-1f60-4f31-be43-9844d1cd16e8">

<p>If the dip lasts more than a couple of weeks and if it tests the 100-day MA (blue), it will be a sign that sellers are fairly aggressive. The dip was deeper and it lasted longer than bulls wanted to see. This is a warning sign that the selling pressure is building. The rally to this point was nice, but this would be a sign that the move is over-extended. If I see this pattern, it will tell me that a lower high double top is setting up and that would shift my bias to bearish. It would be a clear sign that resistance is building and the threat of a market breakout to a new all-time high is less likely than a pullback below the recent low. I would start taking starter bearish positions off of the lower high double top and I will add on technical confirmation in the form of a broken up trendline or a major SMA breach like the 100-day MA.</p>

<p>In summary, I will be watching this dip. If it is brief and shallow as I suspect, I will buy on the notion that we could challenge the high. I don’t want this dip to last more than a week and I don’t want it to go much lower. This is very important because it is a sign that buyers are still aggressive. I will hold bullish positions and I will expect that at very least, the market will test the all-time high. When we test the high, I want nice long green candles and heavy volume on the way up. I will hold longs, but I want to see an immediate breakout with follow through. I will be very cautious at the all-time high because we’ve seen resistance there. If the market can’t breakout immediately, we could stay trapped in a range and I will start taking profits on my longs. The bid is still fairly strong and so is resistance. If we don’t make a new all-time high a week after the bounce begins, I will take gains on my remaining longs. I will stay neutral (balanced) and I will reduce my trade size.</p>
<p>If the current dip lasts two weeks and if the SPY drops down to the 100-day MA, I will be less bullish. We will see a bounce, but I will not trade it as aggressively. I will be watching for signs of exhaustion and I will be looking for a lower high double top. Then my bias will shift to a more bearish tone.</p>
<p>This is how traders adapt to changing market conditions. The previous price action tells us what to expect and we look for “tells” along the way. We are aware of the price action that would get us more bullish or more bearish and we are proactively looking for technical confirmation.</p>
<p>This is where my mind is currently and I will trade based on the outcomes above. It’s important for me to describe the current set up because it is a real-time example of what is happening and how I am applying the lessons I’m teaching. The timeline for all of this is April 2024 and you will be able to go back and see how this all played out. I am not just describing what has happened, I am revealing my current analysis. These are the scenarios that will unfold. The patterns will tell me how to trade in the future. I will be watching for the signs and I will be proactive. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stair_Step_Pattern">Stair-Step Pattern</h2>
<p>There is a reason I spent so much time on the current set-up. Market rallies often transition into a stair-step pattern and this is the type of analysis you go through for each of the dips. This is what I would consider a “normal” rally with “normal” price action.</p>
<p>A stair-step pattern can be characterized as taking two steps forward and one step backwards. This might look like a fairly easy trend to trade, but it’s not. You will notice that there are many pullbacks along the way. The size of the “stairs” is not uniform and each of them provides valuable clues on the strength of the rally. When the upward momentum stalls and the candle bodies are tiny, you should reduce your swing trades and you should expect a dip. As these candles form, you recognize that they are signs of selling pressure. The momentum has stalled and you are taking gains (reducing risk). You will notice that there are NOT many long bodied candles at the height of the bounces in the chart below. That means that the intraday ranges are compressed and these are difficult day trading conditions. The time to “spread your wings” is on pullbacks that find support. Those breakouts through the blue dotted lines are where you can get aggressive with short-term swing trades because there should be momentum for a week or two. Notice that we do not get many of those during the year. That means you have to strike when the iron is hot. Those gains might have to feed you for a month or more. We are throttling our activity based on where we are in the cycle. We reduce risk at the top of the bounce. We gauge the depth and duration of the dip. That is going to tell us how strong the trend is and how high the bounce should be. Brief and shallow bounces that last a few days are more bullish than deep drops that last weeks. We wait for support to be confirmed during the trough and we buy the breakout (blue dotted line). We are more aggressive on the brief and shallow dips than we are on the deep and prolonged dips. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Bull_Market_Transitions">Bull Market Transitions</h2>
<p>Bull markets often transition into horizontal trading ranges. If the horizontal trading range is tight (compressed) and if it has come after a big rally, that is a pause. Buyers and sellers are temporarily in balance, but buyers are in control. The recent gains are holding and buyers are nibbling away at the supply (profit taking). In time, buyers will exhaust the supply and the next move higher will start. </p>
<p>In the final stages of an up trend, the market will lose its nice tight orderly pattern and the peaks and valleys will increase. The price action becomes “loose” and upward momentum degenerates. A trading channel results. There might still be a slight upward bias, but that will eventually disappear. Buyers and sellers are largely in agreement and neither side has the upper hand. Horizontal trading ranges can last for many months. The market is waiting for a macro catalyst and it will take time for corporate earnings to catch up to valuations. That could lead to an upside breakout. Perhaps economic conditions are gradually slowing while the market is in a sideways range. That might set up for a move lower. As a trader, you are gauging each drop and each bounce just like the real-time example I provided above. The price action will help us time the next move and horizontal trading ranges often have a rhythm to the cycle. In the weekly chart below, you can see how the market transitioned from bullish to neutral to bearish. </p>

<p>All good things must come to an end and bull markets will eventually transition into a bear market. It might take years for this to happen, but eventually it will. The macro forces that were in play have changed. Perhaps interest rates are rising or economic conditions are deteriorating. As long as the market is not concerned with credit conditions, you can expect very stubborn price action in the initial stages of the bear market. Bull markets die hard. The market spends much more time moving higher than it does moving lower. Buyers have been conditioned to buy dips. That means the first dip is likely to have a big bounce. There is no need to try to pick a market top. You need to wait for that lower high double top. Why? Look at every one of the dips in the chart below. I can guarantee you that there were shorts who considered each of those dips a market top. They shorted and those moves reversed sharply. Then they took huge losses. </p>

<p>When economic growth is declining, the Fed will lower interest rates and they will try to keep the “party” going as long as possible. That makes the transition from a bullish market to a bearish market more difficult to trade. Intraday ranges expand. That is good for day trading and it is not a good backdrop for swing trading because the market could go either way. Buyers and sellers are battling and the overnight moves in both directions are big. From a swing trading standpoint, the initial transition from a bullish market to a bearish market is a good time to keep your “powder” dry. As a short in a bear market, you are always fighting the Fed because they are adding liquidity and that causes big bounces.</p>
<p>The transition from a bullish market to a bearish market in the chart below happened over a period of months. At the end of 2021, the dips were deeper and they lasted longer (left side of the chart). This was a sign that the selling pressure was increasing. On the last rally (middle), we saw a marginal new high and the big retracements from the high indicated strong resistance. This is when we went largely to cash (no swing trades). By the way, cash is a position. Market volatility was increasing and the long mixed candles told us that conditions were uncertain. The long candles depict big intraday ranges and we didn’t have to swing trade. This was a great time to day trade and that was one of the primary transitions we made as traders. You can see that during 2022, it took a long time to discourage buyers. We finally had a technical breakdown and a lower high double top. Even then, we had to short when the bounces stalled and when they rolled over. The drops were fast and when there was a deep drop, we had to take gains during extreme weakness. If you overstayed your welcome, the bounces were violent. Once the down trend was established, there were swing trading opportunities on the short side, but you had to wait for the bounces to stall. This was not a market where you could just buy puts and let them ride. You had to actively manage your entries and exits. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Embrace_The_Red">Embrace The Red</h2>
<p>Many traders don’t know how to short. They only know how to trade from the long side and they are washed out quickly. Some of them routinely sell out of the money bullish put spreads to generate income and that strategy doesn’t work when the market is declining. Call buyers take a beating and they keep averaging down during the dips until they run out of money. Traders struggle to go from “buy the dip, buy the dip, buy the dip” to “short failed bounces, short failed bounces, short failed bounces.” Their “buy the dip” mindset could have been deeply engrained over a period of years. Some traders have never experienced a bear market they are shocked to learn that the market actually does go down. Traders who are somewhat seasoned and who do short are surprised by how fast and deep the drops are. Trading bear markets takes some getting used to. Traders also forget how violent the snap back rallies can be in a bear market. Instead of two steps forward and one step backwards in a bull market, the moves are more like three steps down and two steps back in a bear market. If you are not well-versed at shorting, you should work on it. Even in a bullish market there will be very weak stocks and you can short one share just to get a feel for it. Knowing how to short gives you greater awareness and you are able to see “both sides of the coin.” This will also prepare you for future bear markets.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Know_What_To_Look_For">Know What To Look For</h2>
<p>If the market faces credit issues, the bearish price action will unfold slowly and it will seem like a normal bear market. If you start seeing financial stocks tank, that is a big warning sign. Credit is the oil that lubricates the economic engine and we don’t want that engine to lock up. Watch global interest rates. If there are credit concerns, they will start to rise quickly in problem countries. If you hear of bank failures, your guard should be up. The selling pressure will accelerate quickly and the drops will be very deep. The long red candles will start to stack and VIXX/VXX will shoot higher. These are gut wrenching times. The only good thing about them is that once you get short, ride those trades as long as you can. When option IVs spike, look for cheap options on stocks that don’t typically move much. Eventually, “the baby gets thrown out with the bath water” and they will fall. Take gains when you see the first bullish hammer off of a new low or a bullish engulfing candle. These moves lower will be deeper and they will last longer than you ever imagined. </p>
<p>We don’t have many trading opportunities where we can be mechanical in our execution. During the year, we might only have a few weeks where we can really ride trades and where the trend is strong. Those periods typically surface around short-term trend reversals. The rest of the time we are looking for clues and the market is transitioning. Sometimes the transition is from a strong trend to an upward sloping trading channel. Sometimes the transition if from an upward sloping trading channel to a horizontal trading range. We constantly monitor price action. Every dip and every bounce provides us with valuable clues. Brief shallow dips are more bullish than deep prolonged dips in the context of an up trend. Dips that are deeper and that last longer than the previous one are a bearish warning sign. If the dips increase in frequency, that is also a sign of increasing selling pressure. You are a race car driver and you are watching for curves and straight aways. You know when to take your foot off of the gas and when to floor it. You also know when to make a pit stop (cash).</p>
<p>To give you some perspective, we had a bull market from 1987 – 2001. Then we had a bear market from 2001 – 2003. Then we had a bull market from 2003 – 2008. Then we had a bear market from 2008 – 2009. Then we had a bull market from 2009 – 2022 (if you don’t count the Covid-19 crash which lasted a month). Then we had a bear market from 2022 – 2023. Bear markets don’t happen that often, but it’s important to identify them. They will wipe an account out very quickly. In the last 44 years, we have only been in a bear market for four of those years. Most of the time, we are trading flat or bullish markets. The character of the market does change and it is important for us to read price action and to adjust our game plan accordingly. This is a skill that you will develop over time. </p>
