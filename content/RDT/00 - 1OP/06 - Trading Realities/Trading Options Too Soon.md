<p>Even though the Options Analysis section appears before the Common Mistakes section in the course, it was the last one I wrote. More than 90% of this content was written without even mentioning options. This should give you some idea of where options fall in the overall trading spectrum. They are the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard that options are the best thing to happen to trading. Imagine a product where you can make money if the underlying goes up in price, stays flat or goes down! People are making 200% and more per trade. How exciting! This is a sure-fire way to take your tiny account and to grow it quickly. Oh yes, I forgot to mention one of the favorite “buzz words.” Your risk is limited. OMG, you mean to tell me that all I can lose is 100% of my investment? Yes! Well… sign me up, what a deal!</p>
<p>There are “gurus” who want to sell you their “option trading secrets” for a small fortune. They will throw big works at you like intrinsic value, time decay, implied volatility and delta. Surely these folks are smart. They make options trading sound like the solution to all of your trading problems. </p>
<p>Novice traders like to brag about their “big winners” because they want to impress you. Monster percentage gains from options trading are just the way to do it. By the way, you never here them brag about their losers. If you happen to see these folks six months later, there is a good chance they aren’t trading options… or anything else. “Gurus” know that they have to promote big percentage gains to lure you in. You start thinking of how much money you are going to make. Do you really believe that your path to riches is through someone else? Apparently, some people do or these guys would not be spending a ton of money on advertising.</p>
<p>There are options software programs that will tell you the optimal strategy to use for a trade. Surely these will help you to be successful. They could, but here’s the missing element. You have to accurately forecast the market D1 and the stock D1. That forecast will need to include direction, speed and magnitude for the market and the stock. That’s the issue. You are a novice trader and you don’t know how to do that. Don’t feel bad, most “gurus” don’t know how to do that either. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Options_Are_The_Icing_On_The_Cake">Options Are The Icing On The Cake</h2>
<p>Options are the pinnacle of trading. They are the very tip of the pyramid. Before you can successfully trade options, you have to learn everything in the base of the pyramid. If you don’t know what you are doing, options trading will just speed up the rate at which you lose money. </p>
<p>“But Pete, what about selling naked puts on stocks I want to own?” If you are willing to buy the stock, go ahead. Just make sure you hold 50% of the strike price in reserve and make sure you know how to pick good companies. This is an investment strategy. There is still thought and research that has to go into this. If you don’t pick good stocks, you will be left with a basket of garbage.</p>
<p>“But Pete, there is a delta neutral trading strategy where I don’t need to know the direction, duration or magnitude of the move. It sells naked straddles and iron condors.” Wonderful. You’ve found a way to get rich and you don’t have to know anything. Do you really believe this? </p>
<p>“But Pete I’m poor and I don’t have enough money to trade stock. Options are all I can afford.” Have you learned a trading system for years and paper traded shares? Is your win rate greater than 75% for a few months consecutively? Have you paper traded options? Be careful even if you have. Some of the paper trading option fills are not realistic. If you have, you might be able to give it a try on a very small scale. Small accounts are very difficult to grow and I wrote about that. </p>
<p>The problem is that novice traders have not gone through the process and they have not hit the performance metrics they need to trade options. They just want to rush in and prove that they are the exception to the rule. </p>
<p>Even if you have successfully traded stock with a great win rate, the transition to options takes time. If you get the timing wrong and the strategy wrong, the options will expire worthless and you will lose money. If you had just traded the stock, you would have made money. It takes time to learn which options strategy to use and when to use it. Know that you don’t even have to trade options to be a successful trader. </p>
<p>Don’t rush your options trading. You will burn through your capital quickly and for most novice traders, their first options trading experience will be their last trading experience of any kind. </p>
