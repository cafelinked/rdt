<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Many traders will smother a good trade. You’ve marked all of the checkboxes, but you start having doubts. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>You are in complete control just before you enter a trade. Once you are “in,” you are at the mercy of the stock and the market. You have to trust your analysis. Do you have any reason not to trust your analysis? You might be a novice trader who is still learning. In that case, you should be trading 1 share so the losses are tiny. Take the trade and stop worrying about it. Learn everything you can from the trade. This is a necessary part of the process. If you are a seasoned trader and you are nervous, it is probably not a high odds trade. Perhaps the market is choppy. In those instances, you take a small “starter” position because the odds are lower. You have identified market support and the stock has relative strength. Give it a little room to breathe. You don’t need to micro manage every tick. If you can’t stop looking at it, set an alert above and below the current price so that you are notified, then move on.</p>
<p>This scene from “<a href="https://youtu.be/pJugO-Fiwws?si=vHIzmx3je-Qi-y5F&amp;t=49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tommy Boy</a>” reminds me of what I see many traders do. The trade is your new “pet.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Define_A_Waiting_Period">Define A Waiting Period</h2>
<p>I am a stickler for good entries and I don’t advocate being sloppy. Provided that you aren’t, give it a chance to perform. You aren’t chasing long candles and you aren’t buying during a big drop. You’ve waited for your window to set-up. When you enter the trade, define a waiting period. The stock might not move right away and that’s OK. It might even pullback initially. There’s a reason why you entered right now and why you felt that this was the right time. As long as everything is in line with what you expected, stay the course. You have previous price action to lean on and that sets the tone. If your time has elapsed and you have not gotten the move you expected, then you can decide to exit. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Give_Profitable_Trades_Some_Space">Give Profitable Trades Some Space</h2>
<p>When the trade starts to go your way, give it some breathing room. Are the dips normal in size? We know what “normal” is from the previous price action. Some stocks are choppier than others so identify the size of the dips you are comfortable with. Most stocks do not go straight up or straight down. They have dips along the way. Ideally, you bought one of those dips. You want very few retracements back into the previous bar and you want lots of green candles. In the chart below the stock is grinding higher. It has nice tight orderly price action and it is above all of the major MAs and AVWAPE. It also has relative strength. The trader has excellent gains and they are nervous. At the first sign of trouble (bearish engulfing candle), they hit the panic button and they exit. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Embrace_The_Red_Candles">Embrace The Red Candles</h2>
<p>As long as everything else is intact, be aware of the bearish engulfing candle. It is a yellow flashing traffic light that tells you to proceed with caution. It does not mean “run for cover.” Learn to embrace those red candles. What happens after that red candle often indicates how much more upside the stock has. The one above is not over-sized. If it represented a 5% move, obviously you would be on very high alert and you should be checking the news wires to see why the stock dropped like that. In this instance, the bearish engulfing candle is erased immediately. This is a sign that the stock is going higher. Instead of exiting the trade, you should be adding on this confirmation. If that bearish engulfing candle has follow-through to the downside, it is a sign that the stock is starting to lose its momentum. It has not dipped previously and that tells us the trend is very strong. We still do not need to bail on the stock. With price action this tight and orderly, it is at very least going to test the previous high. That knowledge gives us the confidence we need to stay the course. If the stock struggles to get through that previous high, we can start to take gains. If the stock powers through the previous high, we stick with the trade and we might even add. This was the first sign of selling so we watch for price compression or future red candles. Those would be a sign that the trend has run its course. </p>
<p>We are only picking stocks with very tight, orderly price action and strong trends. That is a sign that institutions are buying. If you are trading a choppy stock that is all over the board, those dips could gain traction and the stock could have a deep drop. Then your caution would be justified… but we aren’t trading those stocks. There’s no need to compromise and we can always find stocks that are in a strong trend. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stay_The_Course">Stay The Course</h2>
<p>Give the trade some time to produce. If you were patient with your entry, let it move around a little. As long as the market and the stock are “behaving,” stick with it. If your time has elapsed, exit the trade and set upside alerts so that you know when it is making a move. Once you are in the trade, remind yourself why it still looks good. If all of the checkboxes are still marked, don’t mess with it. Embrace red candles. There will be profit taking along the way. As long as the dips are normal, prepare yourself mentally to weather them. Be confident in your ability to identify nice, tight, orderly trends and know that off of any dip the stock at minimum is going to get back to the prior high. The price action after the dip is going to tell you how much “gas” is left in the tank. An immediate surge to a new relative high is a sign that it still has more room to run and it might be time to add to the position. </p>
