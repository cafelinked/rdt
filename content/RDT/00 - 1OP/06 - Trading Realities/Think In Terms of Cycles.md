<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Novice traders tend to think in linear terms, but that’s not how the market moves.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>When traders put their business plan together they know how much they need to “cover” their bills and to have a little left over. Let’s say that number is $500/day. In their mind they need to make that every day and when they don’t, they get nervous. They start forcing trades in a low probability market and they lose money. It’s like “Chinese water torture” when the market has no pace or direction. Stocks breakout and you have confirmation that the breakout is holding, so you buy. Unfortunately, there’s no market tailwind to fuel the move so the stock retreats leaving you with a small loss. Now it’s even harder for you to hit those daily goals. If you lose $500 in a day, the next day you have to make $500 to get back to even, you have to make the $500 you didn’t make the day before and you have to make the $500 you need for today. You have to make $1500 just to get back on track and you can see how a small losing streak can quickly get you in “the hole.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The_Market_Ebbs_Flows">The Market Ebbs &amp; Flows</h2>
<p>Here’s the problem. The market doesn’t move in a linear fashion. It has ebbs and flows and we can see that in the price action on a D1 chart. You need to think more like a professional Black Jack player that counts cards. When the odds are low, they keep their bets small. When the odds are high, they increase their bets. </p>
<p>Instead of thinking that you need to make $500, $500, $500… start thinking that the actual pattern will be more like $0, $0, $1000, $2000, $500, $0, $0… The market moves in cycles and not in a straight line. You need to sit idle when the odds are low and you need to strike when the odds are high. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="How_Many_Decent_Trading_Days_Per_Year_">How Many Decent Trading Days Per Year?</h2>
<p>There are 365 days in a year. We need to remove the weekends (104 days) and the 10 exchange holidays. Holidays typically result in dull price action the day before and the day after so we can remove another 20 trading days. We have 8 FOMC meetings a year so we can remove the day before the Fed meeting and the day of the announcement. We also have at least 1 major economic release a month (typically the focus is on the Unemployment Report). That removes another 12 days a year because the action the day before is usually dull. The week between Christmas and New Years is slow. The middle of August is typically dull as well. People take vacations before the kids go back to school, the Fed is in recess and so is Congress. So now there are another 15 days that we can remove. We are left with 188 days out of the year. The number of possible days when we can make money day trading has been cut in half. I haven’t even accounted for major holidays in other countries or bank holidays (they impact our volume). If the market has a large move the prior day, the next day is likely to be dull “inside day.” If the market is not trending, there will be many low probability trading days. When you look at a chart, look at the number of days when the candle bodies are long and the number of days when the candle bodies are tiny. At most, I believe there are 150 decent trading days a year and that number is probably closer to 120 trading days if I’m being honest. </p>
<p>This is very disappointing when you think about it and it frustrates the heck out of traders who are trying to make $500 a day. So what’s the solution?</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Trading_Futures_vs_RS_RW">Trading Futures vs RS/RW</h2>
<p>First of all, if you are day trading /ES (S&amp;P 500 futures) or /NQ (NASDAQ futures), you are scalping. Most days the volume is low and the intraday range is compressed. The price action is very choppy/sloppy because most of the activity is driven by trading programs. There are professional /ES traders, but this is a very tough way to make a living. I know, I’ve gone down this path so I speak from experience. I still trade /ES, but only on <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/short-term-technical/trend-days/">trend days</a> to give myself an extra “kicker” (size up when the odds are high). I’m not going to write an article on this. Just know that it is a very easy way to increase your exposure and you can gain a lot of leverage with /ES. I might get a few of these a month. For all other days, keep in mind that institutions trade /ES. The liquidity is excellent and they need to trade “size.” We are the “little guy.” Why do we need to compete on their turf? We don’t have to. We have our own advantages so we need to make use of them.</p>
<p>When the market is not giving us much to “look at,” there are always stocks that are moving. We have thousands of stocks to trade and the patterns are fantastic. If we can make money trading 1000 or 5000 shares, it can provide us with a great income. Institutions would not even consider these trades because they are not “big enough.” We might not have a market tailwind most days, but we don’t have a headwind either. As long as the price action (D1 and M5) is tight and orderly and the volume is good, we have a candidate. During the day, we can time our entry/exit based on SPY movement using 1OP. Ideally, the stock is on a mission and it is oblivious to the market. That is a sign that longer-term institutional money (funds) are buying it. In those instances we try to “ride” the move. When we don’t have that market tailwind, we trade smaller size. We can still make money, but we have to lower our expectations (set passive targets). We can also watch for sector rotation. There will be days when nothing looks good and where it is impossible to find a stock that is trending. It happens and you need to be able to walk away. This is when you spend the day placing alerts. Keep busy and set yourself up for future moves, but don’t trade. By trading stocks (and not /ES), we’ve recovered many of the days when there isn’t much market movement.</p>
<p>There will be trend days when all of the “tumblers” are aligned. The SPY D1, the SPY M5, the stock D1 and the stock M5. Everything on the “menu” looks good. This is when you have to strike as a day trader. You might only get a few trend days a month. They can start out as a dull “sleeper” and gradually gain momentum. Watch for a steady grind higher with little to no retracement. Just because a day starts out dull, don’t assume it will stay that way. Keep your focus and stay engaged. Your starter positions will be performing and you will be able to add on confirmation. As the day unfolds you will recognize the strength. This is when you have to strike so make it count.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Swing_Trading">Swing Trading</h2>
<p>Another way to smooth out your performance as a day trader is to swing trade. There will be times when swing trading is more effective than day trading and vice versa. </p>
<p>The SPY D1 chart will give us the context and it will tell us when to expect trend days and when to expect low probability days. It will also tell us when to swing trade. Think like a NASCAR driver. Decelerate into the turns and hit the gas on the straight aways. You should not have the “pedal to the metal” during the entire race and there will be pit stops (cash). I’ve described much of this price action in the article on <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/trade-management/when-to-hedge/">hedging</a> so you can reference it there. The chart below will give you a visual in an up trend. </p>

<p>Know that the cycles will not always be equally spaced like they are in the chart above. Conditions were stable for years and the macro backdrop did not change much. That resulted in the nice orderly trend.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo__Market">2022 Market</h2>
<p>In 2022, the macro backdrop changed and the Fed started to raise interest rates. After an 18-month bull market that rallied 100% off of the low, we had to wait for technical confirmation that the up trend was going to reverse. That meant keeping swing trades to a bare minimum. If we did get the trend reversal, we were going to have some great opportunities to make money on the short side. In the chart below, the blue boxes show you where we could have been more active swing trading. Some of the cycles lasted longer than others. That is the nature of bear markets. You will also notice that the bounces were violent. We did have a series of lower highs so it was important to wait patiently for resistance at the major SMAs and for a technical breakdown. The intraday ranges were very wide so there were excellent day trading opportunities. From a swing trading perspective, we were in and then sidelined. There were extended periods where we had to be passive with swing trades. That was not a problem because the intraday ranges were wide and there were plenty of day trading opportunities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo__Market_5">2023 Market</h2>
<p>In 2023, there were signs that the bear market was over and we had a nice up trend during the summer that was getting tired. We had a giant bearish engulfing candle off of a relative high. We had to wait patiently for confirmation of a reversal so that was a “pit stop” for swing traders. That is when you keep your swing trading to a minimum because there will be big overnight moves in both directions and we do not have a clear sense of market direction. There will be good day trading opportunities. Buyers and sellers are battling it out and there wide intraday ranges. You can see that by the size of the green and red D1 candles in the middle of the chart below. As the move unfolded, we learned that there were only a few swing trading windows during this drop. The bounces were too violent. That was a sign that buyers were still interested and that this was a weak trend lower. You had to short failed bounces and you had to take gains into deep drops. This price action provided us with very important clues. The market had found its footing after a bear market in 2022 and this pullback was not strong. When the market found support, we were going to get a big rally.</p>
<p>The market was in the process of reversing a short-term down trend and it was going to rejoin the long-term up trend. In the early stages of this process, the cycles will last longer. This is when you want to take longer-term swing trades and when you want to aggressively day trade from the long side. We can also expect some “Gap and Go” moves higher and we can join them early in the day. This move is going to gain traction and we are going to move higher with vigor. You might only get this set-up every few years so be aggressive. Here is a post I made on Reddit just before the move. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/comments/17ekofm/this_post_will_make_you_a_lot_of_money_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Post Will Make You A Lot of Money!</a></p>

<p>As of this writing, you can see how the upward momentum is starting to wane in the chart below. The candle bodies are fairly small indicating that the intraday ranges are tight. This is a time to be more passive. Take gains on longer term swing trades and wait for the next opportunity to set up. We just gorged ourselves for 4 months and those gains are going to feed us for a few months. Day traders have to watch for bullish trend days. When the intraday action is light (most days), you have to find stocks with heavy volume breakouts and they need to have nice orderly price action. Keep your trades small. If you can’t find these stocks, set alerts. Do not force trades!</p>

<p>The market has ebbs and flows. It doesn’t move in a linear fashion so you need to adjust your trading to fit the conditions. There will be times when you rely more on day trading. When the market is transitioning from one trend to another, buyers and sellers will be battling it out and there will be big intraday ranges for day traders to feast on. Once a trend reversal is confirmed, those early cycles tend to last a few weeks or more. In time, those cycles will not be as dramatic and they won’t last as long. There will be retracements and you need to time those cycles for your swing trades. </p>
<p>If you strip out all of the days I mentioned earlier in this article, we don’t have a market tailwind for most of them. That means that day traders have to remain cautious and they need to wait for trend days. If the intraday ranges start to expand and if we see mixed D1 candles, it is a sign that a big move is coming. Buyers and sellers are battling and one side or the other will prevail. This is great for day trading, but we hold off on swing trading. It could be a trend reversal, but we need technical confirmation before we can swing trade in that direction. Bear market cycles tend to be more violent. The drops and the bounces are bigger. Wait for failed bounces and short weak stocks. Take gains into deep troughs knowing that the bounces will be violent. Bull market cycles tend to be fairly brief and shallow. The entire trend is more orderly. It is common to have tough trading conditions in a bull market. You have patiently wait for those dips and when you get them you have to strike quickly and with confidence. They won’t last long. When you get the next leg higher, look for signs of exhaustion and take your gains. The context from the D1 chart of the SPY and the stock will provide you with valuable clues on how to trade each cycle. </p>
