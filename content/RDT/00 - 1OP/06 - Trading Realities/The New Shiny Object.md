<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Novice traders are constantly searching for the “Holy Grail” or the “Black Box.” It doesn’t exist and this quest is going to make your journey much longer than it has to be. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Everyone wants to make as much money as they can and they want to expend as little effort as possible. This is particularly true of people who want to get rich quick or who have tried the “hard way” and their trading is not progressing. “If only the alerts did this. If only the indicator did that. I watched a video of a guy who uses a variation of XYZ indicator and it nails the moves. There’s this programmer who designed this automated AI trading algorithm and he is only offering it to 100 traders. Has anyone followed Trader Joe? He has a lot of followers and he is selling his system.” Does any of this sound familiar?</p>
<p>Now that I’ve written the paragraph, it does sound similar to The System (except that I don’t charge for that education), Option Stalker Pro and the 1OP indicator. The difference is that I’m not promising you riches or even success. The System provides us with the decision making framework and I explain why the edge exists, the Option Stalker Pro searches help us identify the best stocks, 1OP helps us to gauge market direction/strength and the chat room brings all of the puzzle pieces together in real-time. You still have to do the heavy lifting and I hope that none of my members feel that I am promoting a fast or easy way to make money trading. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The_Truth_About_Trading_Systems">The Truth About Trading Systems</h2>
<p>The industry is filled with liars who prey on the greedy and the lazy. If these “gurus” had an easy way to make money, they would beg, borrow, and steal to fund their own personal trading account and they would work the “special indicator” or the “Black Box” system until the cows come home. If it is truly special, they would eventually make so much money trading it that they would run into liquidity issues because they can’t get enough size off. Why would they want to share this with anyone?</p>
<p>To be brutally honest, if I could find a way to automate a 1OP trading system for /ES, I wouldn’t share it with anyone. Trust me, I’ve tried for years and I have spent a fortune on this quest. My reality was that the indicator while useful, still required interpretation. The same is true of all of the trading I’ve done. The human brain can process so many variables and it can adapt to changing conditions. My conclusion years ago was that the only way to trade is to do it manually.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Ditch_Get_Rich_Quick_Schemes">Ditch “Get Rich Quick” Schemes</h2>
<p>Here’s the key to this article. Don’t focus on get rich quick schemes. If the “Black Box” was good, they would not sell it to you. If there is a track record, was the P&amp;L verified? Over what period of time? Certain systems work well in certain markets, but they fail miserably in other markets. Why are they selling it, why don’t they just trade it?</p>
<p>The System I teach and that we trade has been time tested and we are all living proof that it works. You can see it in the trades that are posted each day in the chat room. I’ve spent years testing the indicators that I suggest using. Every indicator measures price movement, volume and time. They are all variations of each other. Get proficient with your trading and focus on your win rate. Don’t let yourself be distracted by some new indicator. Once you’ve mastered this and you are successfully trading, then you will have time to experiment with other concepts and strategies. This curiosity is healthy and I encourage it. The point is to master one method that consistently produces results before you move on to something else. When you do move on, experiment with your own concepts and not something that an unknown “guru” is trying to sell you.</p>
