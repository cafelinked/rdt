<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Many traders take too many positions and this makes it harder to manage the trades. Cull out the marginal picks and focus on the best. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Asset Managers spread risk out over many uncorrelated assets for diversification. They take long-term positions that might last for years and they are not in and out of stocks. They adhere to the old investment adage, “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” We are not investing and that advice doesn’t apply to short-term trading. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. We are riding the fastest horse and our goal is to find the “best of the best.” Short-term trading is like the Pony Express. When one horse tires, we jump on a fresh one. We control our risk by keeping our trade duration short. We are aware of scheduled events (like earnings) and we avoid them. If you read the notes from your trade logs, there will be certain trades that you felt much more confident in. Chances are they performed well. Think of how your P&amp;L would have improved if you had eliminated all of the marginal trades. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Find_The_Best_Of_The_Best">Find The Best Of The Best</h2>
<p>Early in your trading career, it will be difficult to find the “best of the best.” The opening bell rings and you are excited by all of the great trading opportunities. You have fasted and you just walked into an all-you-can-eat buffet. Everything looks good and you pile your plate as high as you can. You are spread out across many stocks and you might feel that you are reducing risk by diversifying. “Some of these will work out and some of them won’t.” The problem is that you are not carefully analyzing each pick, you are not being patient and you can’t properly manage all of these positions. This is a “shotgun” approach and you are not going to hit a 75% win rate. Your slippage is going to be higher (commissions and bid/ask spreads) and you are more exposed to adverse market moves. You are not ultra selective and your odds of becoming a “bag holder” (holding on to losing positions) increase. Let’s take a look at some of these issues in greater detail. </p>
<p>What I’m describing above doesn’t just apply to day trading, it is also true for swing trading. As a professional trader, I find that a maximum of 10 swing trades and 5 day trades at a time is manageable. I might swap out my holdings if a stock has lost its momentum, but this is a reasonable number of positions to hold. Realize that these numbers are not the norm, they are the extreme.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When_To_Be_Aggressive">When To Be Aggressive</h2>
<p>We have finite capital and our goal as traders is to be as efficient with it as possible. Throughout this course I’ve mentioned checkboxes. They start with the market D1. There are going to be rare instances where we need to act in an aggressive manner and they will typically surface around trend reversals. We need technical confirmation in the form of double tops or double bottoms and in the early stages of the trend reversal we should see strong sustained movement. We might only get a couple of these moments a year on a D1 basis and that is when we could hit the maximum number of positions. In the chart below, you can see our automated trendlines. The shaded areas are the “sweet spots” where we might carry the maximum number of positions. You will notice that the duration is brief on the short side relative to the long side. </p>

<p>When these “sweet spots” set-up, we are more aggressive with our swing trades and our day trades. In a down trend reversal where the market is starting to rally (right side of the chart above), we are looking for stocks that were steadily moving higher even before the market found support. Buyers have been accumulating these stocks so they have a full head of steam. This is where we want to focus our attention. Forget about buying stocks that are still forming a base. Buy the “best of the best” and forget the rest. As you can see in the SPY chart, these periods are fairly brief. The majority of the time we are not carrying as many positions and we are “swapping horses.” We want to stay focused and we want to preserve our flexibility because the market tailwind is not howling and conditions are less certain.</p>
<p>Let’s say that the market is in a D1 up trend (shaded area on the right side of the chart above) and there is a small gap down. This is our best day trading scenario! We wait for market support and we know that a gap reversal would provide us with a great entry point to join that longer-term up trend. We are not looking for stocks that gapped down, we are looking for stocks that are grinding higher and that are above the prior day high. There won’t be many of them. Instead of considering 10 stocks to trade, there might only be 4-5 that are “bucking the trend.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Practice_Being_Selective">Practice Being Selective</h2>
<p>When you spread yourself out too thin, you are not forcing yourself to be selective. Each stock has its own patterns and some of them will be more attractive. It is critically important to identify these characteristics. When you are trading 1 share, write down why you picked XYZ and why you picked ABC. Write down why you believe that ABC will outperform XYZ in your trade logs. When the trades have concluded, write down what happened. Were you right? What was it that made the difference? This is how you refine your stock selection. Try to quantify those characteristics. Was it a D1 breakout? Did it have heavy volume? Was it the price action? Did it gap up? Was it strong relative to SPY? Was there news? Did the stock have any dips? How deep were they? Did the stock drop below VWAP? Was it above the prior day’s high? The more detailed your description, the better. When you do your analysis at the end of the day, go through the searches and look for stocks that had the type of pattern you are looking for. Then start backwards engineering a scan in Custom Search that finds that symbol. Identify the variables that will help you find this pattern in the future. </p>
<p>In the scenario described above (M5 gap down in a D1 up trend), we have the set up we are looking for and we want to buy. The trader using the shot gun approach will buy a little of everything. His attention will be spread out across many different stocks. At times, some of them will perform well and then they will look terrible a few minutes later. This is a whirlwind of positions. The trader won’t know where to focus their attention. In some instances they will “cut” the losers and “ride” the winners, but the winners turn to mush and the losers turn around. Sometimes the opposite is true and it was good to “cut” the winners and “ride” the losers. When you are looking at 20 stocks, it is much more difficult to get a feel for how they are trading. You only get this granularity by monitoring the stock very closely. In the first 30 minutes, you should let the market find its footing and you should search for attractive stocks. This is when you set alerts. If the stock is getting through key price points, they are worthy of a closer look. After an hour of trading, you are starting to zero in on the best prospects. Now you can watch them very closely. When the market dips, what did the stock do? Ideally, it didn’t budge and it is on a steady grind higher.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo__Dogs_Getting_The_Market_Wrong">“Dogs” &amp; Getting The Market Wrong</h2>
<p>The first problem with having too many positions on is that you included some “dogs.” You were not as selective as you should have been. Those trades will require time and attention and you could have spent that energy monitoring the “best” stocks. When you have a basket of winners and losers, you are spinning your wheels. Even if you are making money, the losers are affecting you mentally. You can’t help but wonder why you took those trades. What often happens is that you focus on taking profits on the stocks that are performing and you ignore the ones that aren’t. You figure that they will “come around.” At the end of the day, they never recover and now you are “bag holding” losers overnight. </p>
<p>The other problem with having too many positions on is that you might get the market direction wrong. If you get blindsided by a surprise move, there are too many stock positions and you can’t unwind them fast enough. You could short S&amp;P 500 futures as a hedge, but now you are complicating your trading. That is not the solution. Be selective and take fewer positions, that is the solution. Quality stocks will hold up very well because you have monitored them during a brief market dip or two. You can see that buyers are lined up. If you get the market wrong it will be much easier to reduce your risk. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Monitoring_Your_Stocks">Monitoring Your Stocks</h2>
<p>When you have many positions, you aren’t as able to identify strength in the stock because you are not hawking the M5 charts. Consequently, you don’t know which positions to add to. When you have a few positions on you are keenly aware that the SPY just had a long red M5 bar and the stock had a nice green bar. You can closely monitor each stock and you will be aware of technical confirmation. You will have larger positions in fewer stocks. </p>
<p>When you whittle down to 4-5 really solid picks, your confidence will be much higher because you’ve vetted them carefully. There might be two or three that are performing well and that’s all you need. If market conditions are poor, you might only have one or two stocks of interest. This would be the case during a low probability trading environment (LPTE) where the market is trapped inside of the prior day’s range (“Inside Day”). Out of thousands of stocks, you can almost always find one or two gems no matter how bad the trading conditions are.</p>
<p>I’ve focused more on the day trading side than the swing trading side in this article, but the same concepts apply. If you are spread out across too many stocks, it will be harder for you to track your positions and to adjust. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stock_Diversification">Stock Diversification</h2>
<p>Since you are taking fewer positions, avoid trading stocks from the same group. Also avoid stocks from the same sector if they are all highly correlated. For instance, if three of your five positions are from the energy sector, they are likely to be highly correlated. You don’t want to be that highly concentrated. Pick the one you like the most. Technology companies can be vastly different from each other and having three technology stocks might not be an issue. Just make sure they are not three semiconductor companies (same group). </p>
<p>Shorter-term traders don’t need to diversify across many stocks. The goal is to be in and out of stocks and to ride the momentum until it wanes. Each additional position you take complicates your trading because you have more to monitor. Instead, focus on the best of the best and be ready to add to those positions on technical confirmation. Also be prepared to take gains when the move is exhausted. Constantly search for better prospects and swap out of stocks that have not been performing. Swing trades require less monitoring and we make decisions based on major technical levels on a D1 chart. For that reason we can carry more of them (ten). Day trades require constant monitoring and you should not have more than five open at any time (max). This allows us to closely monitor the price action and we are better able to actively manage the positions. We can add to the position (or reduce it) based on price movement and market conditions. There might be slow days when we only have one or two day trading positions. It is important not to overtrade when the conditions are poor. On a slow day, one nice stock can produce really nice profits. </p>
