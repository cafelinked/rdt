<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Many novice traders fall in love with a stock or a strategy and they are oblivious to everything else that is happening around them. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>I wish I had a nickel for every time that I’ve seen this. A trader will comment on one of my Reddit posts or ask for my opinion on a stock on my YouTube channel. When I bring up the chart, the stock is choppy with no direction. It is trapped in a tight trading range and it has light volume. With thousands of stocks to choose from I wonder, “What they could possibly see in this stock?” </p>
<p>The answer is… they have fallen in love with it. Perhaps they’ve made money on it before or they read a news story that really has them excited about the company. As short-term technical traders, we don’t conduct fundamental analysis. We are aware of scheduled events that might impact it (i.e. earnings), but we do not try to predict the outcome. If the stock is “stuck in the mud” we set alerts at critical price points and we wait for a heavy volume breakout. When the alert is triggered, the stock might be worthy of our attention. Until large institutional traders are interested in the stock, we let it sit and we look elsewhere for opportunity.</p>

<p>These next four scenarios are fictitious, but typical. </p>
<p>“Pete, what do you think about Apple?” It is chopping around on light volume and it is wedged between the 100-day and 200-day SMA. It is still trapped inside of the prior day’s range and it is in a longer term compression with light volume. “I think you have a position in Apple. That is the only reason you would ask me about this stock.”</p>
<p>“Pete, what do you think about Tesla? It’s bouncing off of the 100-day SMA and this could be a good long.” Tesla has found temporary support at a major moving average, but the stock has been weak relative to the market with a heavy volume drop down to that support level. We need more proof that support is going to hold and we need to see the stock rally through technical resistance for confirmation. We also want to see it regain its relative strength. Until then, we understand that the stock could just as easily reverse this bounce and plunge below the 100-day MA. “I think you are itching to buy Tesla and you might have a little bottom picking tendency that is obscuring your vision.” </p>
<p>“Pete, what do you think about selling an OTM bullish put spread on Microsoft? It has relative strength and it has been able to hold this horizontal support level.” The S&amp;P 500 has just broken through the 100-day and the 200-day SMA on long red candles with heavy volume. I think you are in love with selling bullish put spreads. This is a great options trading strategy when the market is neutral to bullish and you are oblivious to the market conditions around you. </p>
<p>“Look at Nvidia scream higher!” This is one of my favorite “tells” that a trader has a position on. I look at the $500 stock and it just moved $.50 higher. This trader has his pom-poms out and he is playing cheerleader. He is camped out on this stock. He’s watching every tick and he is seeing what he wants to see. Chances are, this is his only position because there would be many others he could have highlighted instead. Nvidia could be trapped inside of the prior day’s range and the S&amp;P 500 could be up 50 points, but he still sees this $.50 pop as a victory even though there are hundreds of better opportunities. Without question, he has tunnel vision.</p>

<p>The System starts with long term market analysis. It is critically important to know which way the wind is blowing and how hard it is blowing. The goal is to have it at our back. Then we get the shorter-term market context and we see how the current move fits into the larger picture. Next we find stocks that are moving in the direction of that wind with ease (long candles of a single color through key technical price points on heavy volume). This is a sign that institutions are supporting that move. If you use this decision making process, you will avoid the tunnel vision trap. Instead of starting with “interesting” stocks with a headline that have good option liquidity, but no movement, you will start with the macro backdrop and drill down to the best stocks that institutions have a strong opinion about right now. That is accomplished through stock searches. The goal is to join that move. </p>
<p>Traders have awareness and they know that many checkboxes have to be marked before a trade is taken.</p>
