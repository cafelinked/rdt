<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Your opinion on direction should be rock solid and it should rarely change.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>When you form your market opinion on a D1 basis, it should not change like the wind. This is longer-term analysis and it does not change very often. If you are bullish, you know the type of price action that would change that opinion and you know the technical support levels that would have to be breached to change that opinion. The same is true if you are market neutral or bearish. As directional traders, we are looking for stocks that have a strong trend and momentum. The price action is undeniable and we have a firm directional opinion for the stock. If you don’t have an extremely high level of confidence in the direction of the stock, keep looking. There are thousands of stocks and there is always a great long or a great short – never compromise on the stock.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Neutral_Market_Bias">Neutral Market Bias</h2>
<p>Let’s take the most difficult scenario where you are market neutral. The market could be compressing in a longer-term horizontal trading range or it could be extremely volatile with big swings both ways (typical during a trend reversal). The price action could be difficult to read and you don’t have a directional bias for the market. Given that this is the biggest puzzle piece, you keep your size small and you reduce your trade count. You are market neutral and this is reflected in your position sizing and risk exposure. While the market is searching for direction, there will be stocks that are tanking (relative weakness) and stocks that are flying higher (relative strength). We might carry a mix of longs and shorts because we are market neutral, but when it comes to the direction of the stock, we do not waiver. All of the checkboxes are marked and it would take a considerable contra move in the stock to change our opinion.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What_Would_Make_You_Bearish">What Would Make You Bearish</h2>
<p>Let’s say that a stock is in a very strong uptrend. It has been making higher lows, it is above all of the major SMAs, it has relative strength, it is above AVWAPE, it has heavy volume and it has just broken through a technical resistance level. It is the “strongest of the strong.” All of these checkboxes tell us that institutional buyers are active. Would a two week compression turn us bearish on the stock? No! That is just a resting point in a strong move higher. Would a handful of red candles on heavy volume turn us bearish? No! That is just a normal round of profit taking. We want that dip to be brief and shallow. Then the stock is likely to regain its strength and form a D1 bullish flag and stage the next run higher. Would a lower high double top get us bearish? No, but that would get us neutral if the market was stable. This is a sign of resistance and in a stable market, we expect to see the stock to grind higher and to take out a relative high. The bottom line is that it is going to take a long time and some heavy selling pressure to turn us neutral and it will take even more to turn us outright bearish. The chart below is a strong stock. </p>

<p>If the market broke a key technical support level and that is why the stock made a lower high, we could still preserve our bullish bias. On a relative basis, the stock might still be strong and as soon as the market finds support, the stock will power higher. If the market was relatively stable or even strong and the stock made a lower high, that would cause us to be neutral on the stock. That is when we expect the stock to move higher.</p>
<p>If the breach of market support has changed our market opinion, we need to lighten up on our long stock positions across the board. It would be natural to start by exiting the stocks that are showing the most sensitivity to the market drop.</p>
<p>Notice that all of this analysis has taken place on a D1 basis. That is what we lean on the most. However, this same analysis for the market and the stock continues on an M5 basis. Don’t make the mistake of only doing your analysis on an M5 basis. Everything starts with the longer term chart and then it drills down to the M5 for short-term traders. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Why_Traders_Flip_Flop">Why Traders Flip-Flop</h2>
<p>So where does the flip-flop trading come into play? It is typically the result of changing market conditions, poor analysis, a lack of confidence, reliance on one or two indicators and/or a desire to trade a particular stock. I love it… buy, I like it… buy more, I don’t like it… stop out, I hate it… short. You need to avoid this state at all costs. It is a mental mind f____. You have no clue of what the market or the stock are going to do and you are just reacting to the last move. This is a great way to blow out an account and to destroy yourself emotionally. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Changing_Market_Conditions">Changing Market Conditions</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the market. Remember, we are taking the most difficult scenario where our market opinion is neutral. In another article I discuss the contra trend trader. When our market opinion is neutral, we need to trade smaller size and we understand that we will not have that tailwind helping the position. The stock has to do all of the work so it is likely to have fits and starts along the way. In the example above if the stock made a lower high and if it was market related, it does NOT mean that this stock is a good short. You would not flip from bullish to bearish on a stock if the weakness is market related. You would temper your bullishness and you would exit. This is a strong stock and the long-term buyers are not going to bail just because the market is temporarily weak. When your market opinion changes, you find stocks that have been weak and that have all of the bearish checkboxes marked. You do not short the strong stock you’ve been long on the notion that massive profit taking is going to set in and that the stock is going to give back all of its recent gains. There is no technical proof that is going to happen. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Poor_Analysis">Poor Analysis</h2>
<p>Poor analysis is a deep seated problem. The trader spends a minimal amount of time conducting market analysis. They don’t have a market opinion or they have a flimsy basis for their opinion. By the way, the entire first section of this course walks you through the process of how to form a market opinion technically and fundamentally. The stocks they select are marginal and they do not have all of the checkboxes marked. These traders are simply chasing “hot” stocks and they are reactive, not proactive. They don’t have a game plan so all of the moves seem random. If everything is random, they feel they need to be flexible and it is only natural to trade both sides of the same stock. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lack_Of_Confidence">Lack Of Confidence</h2>
<p>A lack of confidence is another reason traders flip-flop. This is particularly true for traders who are just starting out. They have a basic understanding of technical analysis and what they should be looking for, but they are still not profitable. They are second guessing themselves constantly. They chase an entry and the position is up a little and they are happy. Then the stock tanks, but they are not surprised. Some are even expecting that to happen. They feel like they are always wrong. “If I want to make money trading, I should just do the opposite of what I think.” So they short the stock. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Over_Reliance_On_Indicators">Over-Reliance On Indicators</h2>
<p>Some traders fall in love with an indicator or study. They don’t have any other checkboxes. The stock rallies above the 100-day SMA… buy, buy, buy. The stock dips back below the 100-day SMA… sell, sell, sell. When it comes to indicators, they are backwards looking. Often by the time an indicator has triggered a signal, the move is over. That is why the we lean on a number of different indicators across multiple time frames. Each is one of many checkboxes and each indicator should measure price action differently. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Desire_To_Trade_Particular_Stocks">Desire To Trade Particular Stocks</h2>
<p>Some traders fall in love with a stock. Nvidia is a great example after a huge run higher in 2023. NVDA… NVDA… NVDA. These traders have tunnel vision. It is all they can think about. If the stock has liquid options, it is sure to be a hit. These traders are going to try and time every random wiggle and jiggle while the stock is trapped in a range. I love it… I hate it… I love it… I hate it. There is no rhyme or reason to these moves and the trader is going to get chopped up. The fact that the stock is trapped in a trading range and that the price movement is choppy is a clue that institutions are indifferent. There is no prevailing trend and your ability to predict the next move is practically zero. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Review_Your_Checkboxes">Review Your Checkboxes</h2>
<p>If you find yourself flip-flopping… <strong>STOP!</strong> Something is broken. This activity is going to destroy your confidence and your account. The first place to look is the market. Has it become more volatile? Has it breached a key D1 price level? Did you miss that piece? Even if the market is neutral, you should still be able to find great stocks. That is the second place to look. Perhaps you are not picking the best stocks. We need nice orderly price action and lots of D1 checkboxes marked. If you have that, it is going to be very difficult for all of those checkboxes to pivot. I have scores of articles on the types of price patterns we look for. Typically, a very strong stock will go from bullish to neutral before it becomes bearish. Do not fall in love with a stock that does not have a strong trend. You can’t predict the next move and that is how we get paid. If you are nervous because you just started trading, paper trade. In time your skills will improve. If you try to trade before you are ready, you will lose your hard earned money and you will damage yourself emotionally. </p>
<p>During the life of a trade, doubt will surface. The market won’t look quite as strong and the stock will waffle. What looked like a slam dunk might not look as promising after you enter. That is when you review your list of market and stock checkboxes. You were confident when you entered the trade. What changed? Often nothing changed, you just needed that reminder and now you are prepared to weather the wiggles and jiggles. If you had many checkboxes marked, your confidence remains high. If you only had one or two checkboxes marked, your confidence is low.</p>
