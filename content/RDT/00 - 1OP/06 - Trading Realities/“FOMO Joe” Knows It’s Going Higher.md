<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Novice traders are easily excited. The opening bell just rang and the “casino” is open for business. They look for “hot” stocks and they “know” this one is going to run. Don’t trade with this crowd.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Most people start trading to find “fame and fortune.” They’ve read a few books or watched a few YouTube videos and they are anxious to get started. Perhaps some co-workers have boasted about how much money they’ve made buying call options. Their expectations are “sky high” and they think “this is going to be fun.”</p>
<p>They haven’t put in the work, they are just going to dive right in and start making money. They convince themselves that, “Everyone on Discord has more experience, so it’s “best” to just follow those trades.” </p>
<p>These traders will chase a stock that is stacking green candles on the open. They don’t care why the stock is up, they just want “some of that action.” These stocks are typically your big tech names that get a lot of press. Nvidia is a perfect example. The stock rallied from $108 in October of 2022 to $975 in March 2024. </p>
<p>This week, bullish speculators have been piling into it so I thought I would write about it. This was a colossal display of stupidity. They were buying weekly call options that were $200 out of the money and that would expire in a few days. My intent during this article is to do everything I can to discourage you from ever trading with this “gang.” I want you to know when you might be doing that and I want you to feel embarrassed when you “run with them.”</p>
<p>Nvidia is a tech giant that makes computer chips and “FOMO Joe” heard they were hosting a conference featuring their new Artificial Intelligence (AI) products. This time he actually did a little homework. The stock gapped up and he was frothing at the mouth. It’s the first day of the conference and “this baby is going to scream higher.” He’s not going to wait, he is going to buy calls right away. Surely Nvidia was going to announce some great new products. </p>
<p>Here are my comments from the chat room Monday morning with the time stamps. I started commenting 10 minutes after the open when the stock was still at its high for the day. This was so perfectly set up for a giant fail, it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. </p>

<p>The option premiums were sky high. “FOMO Joe” paid through the nose for those options. He dove in thinking he might buy some more if the stock keeps going up. He’s not worried about what he might lose, this company is going to announce some great new chips and it’s going higher. He is completely motivated by greed. The stock peaks after 15 minutes of trading and it starts to retreat. He’s not worried, this is just a small pullback and he is going to give it plenty of room. The stock continues to pullback and it drops below VWAP. That’s OK. “FOMO Joe” doesn’t know what that is. The stock takes out the low of the day and he starts thinking that maybe he rushed the gun a little bit. Within two hours of trading, he has been completely fleeced and the stock pulls back $50. In the chart below, you can see how the stock was flat (blue line) on a D1 basis and the options IVs were rising. The Market Makers knew that bullish speculators were buying these calls. They had been doing so the previous week. The premiums were very expensive (the odds of the bullish OTM call buyers making money was low). “FOMO Joe” thinks he’s the only one who knows about this conference and he is going to make a lot of money. By the end of the day, he’s not thinking about that new motorcycle. He’s thinking about how hard he had to work to make the money he lost in a couple of hours. </p>

<p>He doesn’t understand where he went wrong. All of his call buying buddies in Discord got punished as well. The lesson he probably learned was not that he’s a fool. Oh no, that could never be. He learned that the market is rigged against the “little guy” and the Market Makers manipulated the market. They lured him in and then they forced the stock to drop. If this is what he learned, that is a good take away. If you want to make money trading, you have to stop thinking like “FOMO Joe” and you have to start thinking like the institutions. That’s what this whole course is about. </p>
<p>If you EVER suspect that you might be trading with this crowd, do this before you enter the trade. </p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First you should relieve yourself. You’ll know why in a second. </li>
<li>Go into your sock drawer and find a pair of socks. No, not the thin nylon dress socks, you will need the thick “woolies” you wear in the winter for this. </li>
<li>Place one sock over each hand. If you live with someone, ask them to secure them tightly by wrapping duct tape around each wrist. </li>
<li>Good. Now you can’t place a trade using your keyboard. I’m sure some people will figure out a way, but it won’t be easy.</li>

<p>Nvidia was an obvious “train wreck” and here are some of the other set-ups where you need to be careful. “FOMO Joe” lives on the corner of greedy and stupid so he’s pretty easy to find.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Gaps_Up_Through_Minor_Resistance">Gaps Up Through Minor Resistance</h2>
<p>“FOMO Joe” is going to be busy in the first 15 minutes of trading buying SPY calls at a new relative high. The D1 chart for the looks great so he piles in. He doesn’t know why the market is up and he doesn’t know if the gap up is going to hold. All he knows is that this train is about to leave the station so he climbs aboard. If the market is gapping through a minor technical resistance level (20-day SMA or a 5-day high) the move might not hold. That is a resistance level and sellers will be close by. Once “FOMO Joe” is in, the institutions will play “Whack-a-mole.” This is a key price point and what looked like an obvious breakout suddenly transforms into an obvious rejection. “FOMO Joe” gets worried and he takes the loss. This is why we need to wait for confirmation. Remember, most gaps up are tested and many result in a gap reversal. This is not a good risk/reward profile for us.</p>
<p>This same concept applies to stocks, except it’s more common. It is easier to move a stock than it is to move the market. This is minor resistance so it is easily breached. Stacked green M5 candles will excite traders especially when the stock is through a resistance level. Set alerts and try to buy dips. Often when the alert is triggered, the stock will have pulled back below the breakout. The drop will be deep and you will recognize that the initial breakout was a head fake. Mistake avoided. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Gaps_Up_Through_Major_Resistance">Gaps Up Through Major Resistance</h2>
<p>If the market gaps through a major resistance level (100/200-Day SMA, horizontal resistance, or a trendline), that is a bit more convincing because it’s harder to do. Some of that early move could be fueled by a short squeeze as institutions adjust risk. We still need to wait for follow through. Perhaps that breakout will be preserved, but there’s a chance that some of the gap will fill. That will confirm that buyers are interested and then we can join the move with confidence. If the market holds the gap up with little to no retracement after an hour of trading, we can feel confident that the breakout is legitimate. We want to see a steady grind higher on heavy volume and it helps if there has been a catalyst (Fed, earnings or economic release).</p>

<p>Stocks that gap up through major resistance levels are fueled by news. Something has changed. Most frequently, this is due to an earnings release. There is new information that will impact future earnings. It could be that the company “guided higher” or perhaps there was a successful clinical trial. Regardless of the news, we need to make sure the reaction was legitimate. We want to see the stock hold more than half of the gap up before we start to trade it. Ideally, the stock compresses near the high of the first candle that created the gap. There will be profit takers who bought before the gap and they will take gains. That supply needs to be exhausted. Buyers are interested and that is why the stock is not retracing. This is a sign that the news was “good” and it was well-received. Eventually, buyers will get more aggressive and the stock will move higher. You don’t need to be “FOMO Joe.” Many of these moves reverse. Wait for confirmation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Grind_Through_Major_Minor_Resistance">Grind Through Major &amp; Minor Resistance</h2>
<p>You are probably “catching my drift” at this stage. We need confirmation. Let’s talk about breakouts in general. Often the stock will not gap up through resistance. It will gradually work its way towards it and it will poke through it. Now it’s on everyone’s radar. We don’t make money on the breakout, we make money on the follow through. Just because the market or the stock breached a resistance level, there’s no reason to believe that the move is going to hold. Remember, we don’t rush to judgement before the candle has completed. A nice long green candle through resistance often turns into a bearish hammer when it completes. This is a resistance level and we know that sellers have been active here before. “FOMO Joe” believes that every breakout is going to hold so he does not wait for confirmation. The key to this set up is that the move through that resistance level takes place in a nice orderly fashion. Once the market/stock are through that resistance level we want very few dips that retest the breakout. When we do get those dips, we want a strong and instant bounce. We don’t want to linger around that level, we need “escape velocity” from that prior resistance level. It will initially act as a magnet. If the move quickly gains traction, the price action is steady and the volume is heavy, we can take starter long positions. We only add to the position when the orderly price action continues. The dips (if there are any) are brief and shallow.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Bottom_Picking">Bottom Picking</h2>
<p>This is a nasty habit when it comes to personal hygiene and it is also a nasty trading habit. Did you think “FOMO Joe” only buys breakouts? Oh… no… no… no. He is also “the guy” who is going to scoop everyone else. He’s heard that the key to trading is to “buy low and sell high.” When the bottom is falling out from a stock on a D1 basis, he recognizes “value” before everyone else. He is going to “beat them to the punch.” All he can think about is how much money he’s going to make when the stock recovers. </p>
<p>When we have sustained directional movement, a trend forms. We never assume that a trend is going to reverse until we have well-established support, a higher low and a technical breakout to the upside. The more pronounced the decline, the longer it will take the market/stock to establish that support. Sellers are aggressive and we can tell that from the price action. In a strong down trend, there will be bounces. Each of these will excite “FOMO Joe” because he wants to be early. In the chart below, the trend is clear. This is a nice orderly decline and this is a bearish trend day. If it is taking place in a longer-term D1 bullish up trend, there is no need to enter bullish trades. This is a day where you sit on your hands. “FOMO Joe” will be anxious to get long. Every little bounce will represent a buying opportunity. In the chart below I drew in a classic set-up. The market bounces and there is a long green candle through VWAP. Eureka! “This is the move we’ve been waiting for!” Do you think this move would excite “FOMO JOE”? Of course it would. He is not going to wait for confirmation… that would be too late so he buys immediately. That long green candle would be erased immediately and the next leg lower would start. This is such a classic set-up. </p>

<p>One of the keys to trading is to remain calm. Plan your trades and don’t act impulsively. If a big move is underway, our risk is elevated and we need to make “double sure” that it is not going to reverse. Find out what’s driving the price action. In most cases there will be a dip. We want it to be brief and shallow. If we don’t get that, there will at least be a compression. We can buy that breakout as well. The fact that the market/stock has been able to preserve all of the gains tells us that buyers are aggressive and that sellers are not able to put a dent into the bid. There will always be an opportunity to join the move. Not all of them will be legitimate and you will be glad that you did not “bite.” Know that sometimes (rarely) you will miss a trade because you are being patient. Be OK with that.</p>
<p>We need nice, orderly price action on heavy volume and we need that “escape velocity” from the breakout. We don’t lunge, we take starter positions and we add on confirmation. </p>
<p>When the stock has made a huge move and when it is generally “newsie,” we have to be particularly careful. You are not going to “pull one over on Wall Street.” Big moves lure in the unsuspecting and they are often fake. Is there news to justify the move? If not, it is a technical breakout and the likelihood of a dip or a reversal is higher. </p>
<p>Don’t buy big drops that have not confirmed support over a long period of time. The bigger the drop, the longer it will take for support to form. We need to see double bottom higher lows and a breakout above technical resistance before we can start looking for a trend reversal. </p>
<p>Think about who might be excited by the current move you are observing. If there is the slightest chance that “FOMO Joe” is embracing it, don’t take the trade! Then you will be able to keep your socks in the drawer. </p>
