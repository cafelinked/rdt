<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Novice traders are often excited to start. They’ve heard about the fortunes that can be made trading and they are determined to try with what little money they have.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>“You have to start somewhere” is the attitude most novice traders have. They have cut expenses and they have scraped together all they have to fund an account. This money is their “ticket” to fame and fortune. They’ve watched a few videos and read a couple of books and they feel they have the “basics” down pat. The few thousand dollars in the account is very meaningful to them and in some cases, that money might have “temporarily” been borrowed from funds that are going to be used to pay bills. Right out of the gate, the novice trader is going to be faced with the issues of being under-capitalized/overleveraged. They have no staying power because they can’t shoulder a loss, they have little to no experience so they are going to be in bad trades, they have no track record and hence very little confidence when a trade goes sour. This is a train wreck in the making.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Unrealistic_Expectations">Unrealistic Expectations</h2>
<p>One of the reasons novices think that a small account might be viable is that they have unrealistic expectations. I will cover this in great detail <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/common-mistakes/unrealistic-expectations/">in the next article</a>. Perhaps a friend of theirs made money on a trade and that gets them excited. If you search long and hard enough, you will find a “guru” who tells you that it only takes a few thousand dollars to get started. Avoid these scam artists at all costs. They are the only ones who will make money selling you their “secrets.” This profession is very hard and it takes years to develop the skills you will need. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Exhaust_Your_Resources">Exhaust Your Resources</h2>
<p>So what’s the solution? This is a journey and reading books is an inexpensive way to get started. If you plan on becoming a short-term trader, books on technical analysis will teach you the basics. Focus on free sources of information. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/wiki/index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIKI</a> is an incredible resource and you have access to The System. That’s what you are reading right now during the free trial. I don’t charge anything for this, but I could. Watch YouTube videos. You will have to try many different channels until you find someone who actually teaches you how to trade, but once you find that source, exhaust it. Avoid any site or channel that promotes big profits. All of this information is going to teach you about trading, but it won’t teach you how to trade. That is something that is learned through experience. </p>
<p>When you find an approach, it has to have a decision making process. 1. Start here. 2. Check this. 3. Check this. 4. Check this. The structure is clear and you know the exact steps to follow. The next step is to actually try some trades. You can start with paper trading, but I prefer trading 1 share of stock because you actually have some “flesh in the game.” You will be able to track your success and learn from your mistakes with little to no emotional distress. Until you have a win rate that is greater than 75% for a few consecutive months, you do not increase your size. Reaching that level will take years and you will start to appreciate how difficult this is. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Be_Patient">Be Patient</h2>
<p>Most novice traders will not follow this advice. In the age of instant gratification, that process will take too long. They learn what they think they need and they start trading. The account blows up in short order and they are added to the long list of failed traders. Don’t be like them. </p>
<p>“So Pete, how much money do I need once I reach that 75% win rate level?” By the time you get there, you will know the answer. Hopefully, during your journey you have had time to add more money to your trading capital. Given how hard it was to reach that point, you will know to gradually increase your size and you will keep learning.</p>
