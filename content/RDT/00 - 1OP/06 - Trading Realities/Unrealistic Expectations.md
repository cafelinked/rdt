<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Novices believe that trading is an easy way to make money. If this was true, most of the people you meet would be professional traders. How many pros do you know that have been doing it for more than 5 years? </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Anyone with a wallet can open up a brokerage account. The barriers to entry are very low and if you have an good internet connection, you can start with a few hundred dollars and trade with zero commissions. The market always goes up so how hard could it be? This is the prevailing mentality for new traders and there are many reasons why it exists. </p>
<p>This perception is fostered by brokerage ads like the baby who is trading (Etrade). “It’s so easy, even a toddler can do it.” There are countless advertisers on social media promising riches if you just sign up for their “5 start alerts” or their indicator (you don’t have to look farther than the ads on my YouTube videos). Your friend/neighbor/relative boasts about their big options win and you think, “hey if they can do it so can I.” Most people are trying to get ahead in life and they are looking for the path of least resistance. This seems like an effortless way to make money. </p>
<p>“Pete you’re a hypocrite. I see you promoting the 1OP indicator and the Option Stalker Pro searches in your videos.” Let’s address that. These tools will help you to find great trades, but they won’t make you a great trader and I never promise riches. The System provides a structured decision making process and there’s an edge to it, but I don’t guarantee success. In fact, I go out of my way to tell people how hard this is going to be with videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBLe7hxi9v0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Is Day Trading?</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QG2XViJg3s&amp;t=389s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneOption Is Not Right For Everyone</a>. </p>
<p>I don’t advertise because I’m not going to lie. Who’s going to click on an ad that tells you this is going to take years to learn, it is an incredible amount of effort, and there is a chance you will be humiliated? No one, that’s why we don’t have thousands of members. I am trying to be as honest as I can when it comes to trading and I want to be a beacon of light in a sea of shit.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at some of the things you should expect during your journey to become a professional trader. If you are not passionate about this, you will not put the required time in and you will fail. This has to be something that you must truly enjoy doing. Then the 60+ hours a week you put in will go by quickly.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Education">Education</h2>
<p>Before you start trading, you have to understand technical patterns and indicators. That means you have to spend countless hours reading books and learning how to find the set-ups that present the greatest opportunities. You have to read through user manuals to find out how to utilize the tools you have (software). You have to understand the rules and regulations imposed by the industry (PDT, taxation) and you have to understand your brokerage agreement (assignment/exercise). Learning how to trade options requires another level of studying.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>I start my trading day 3 hours before the open. I am scouring the headlines, gauging the reaction to economic releases, looking at stocks that have moved overnight and devising a game plan for the day. You can see the end result in my pre-open market comments. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Research">Research</h2>
<p>I spend 3 hours after the close looking at post earnings reactions, running searches for new trade prospects, setting alerts and reviewing trade logs to see what went “right” or “wrong” with the trades</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Expenses">Expenses</h2>
<p>There are software expenses (scanners and trade logs), data expenses and news feeds. You also have all of your monthly personal expenses that you have to cover with your profits.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Time">Time</h2>
<p>You have to put in years of effort before you make a dime. Most people are not willing to put in the work and they are not willing to wait that long. They want and expect instant success. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Emotions">Emotions</h2>
<p>This journey will teach you more about yourself than you can imagine. How willing are you to admit that you are wrong? Without any measurable progress, how willing are you to keep putting in the effort? How will you handle tough trading conditions when its hard to make money? Do you have the mental fortitude to push forward when everyone else is doubting your career path? How will you handle drawdowns?</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Losses">Losses</h2>
<p>When you have a “bad day at work” in other professions, you still get paid. When you have a bad day of trading, money is taken from you. The next day, you have to make that money back, you have to make what you should have made the day before and you have to hit your daily profit target. This is a very slippery slope and that is why consistency is critically important.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are a professional, by definition, you have mastered a trade/skill and that is what you do full-time to make money. If you wanted to be a doctor, a lawyer or a professional golfer, everyone would appreciate the time and effort required to make that a reality. The same effort is true for trading, but unfortunately, that is not the perception. Are you passionate about trading? Do you have what it takes?</p>
