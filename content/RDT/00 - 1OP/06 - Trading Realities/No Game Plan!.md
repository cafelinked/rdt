<h4 class="wp-block-heading">You need to have a weekly and a daily game plan. Without one, you are just “flying by the seat of your pants.”</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Many traders don’t have a game plan. They turn on their monitors and they log into their brokerage accounts when the opening bell rings. They have no clue of what the market has been doing in recent days because they didn’t do any technical analysis. Consequently, they don’t have any clue of what the market might do or why. They don’t know the most likely scenarios or the ones that would present the best trading opportunities. They haven’t read the overnight news, they haven’t looked at the pre-open movers and they don’t know what happened overseas. If there was an economic release, they don’t know how the market reacted to the news. They don’t know how they’ve traded recently or what they should focus on. As far as a market opinion, they might have one, but it is not supported by any analysis. They are just going to take the day “as it comes.” They will be reactive instead of proactive. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Market_Analysis">Market Analysis</h2>
<p>Market analysis is critically important. That contexts provides the framework for all of our trades. We know where we stand technically on a long-term basis. Our market opinion and our confidence in that forecast determines our trade duration, trade size and options strategies. The overnight news and the overnight movement in the S&amp;P 500 sets the tone and we see how today’s puzzle piece might fit into the overall picture. The price action from the last two days will also provide us with valuable clues on how the day might play out. Is the market in a longer-term trend? Have the recent intraday ranges been compressing? Is the current day likely to be a “Gap and Go” or a “Gap Reversal?” Is it likely to be a “inside day” or could it evolve into a trend day? Are there any major economic releases that are scheduled today or tomorrow? Have they recently had a big market impact? Is this a day where I should reduce risk? Could the trading today be dull ahead of this major news event? What has the market volume been like? Are there any major technical support or resistance levels that are in play today? Have any been breached recently? A trader has to know the answer to all of these questions ahead of time and he has to devise a game plan. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stock_Watchlist">Stock Watchlist</h2>
<p>Which stocks am I focused on? Which ones are moving overnight? Do I own any of them? Do stocks that are moving overnight belong to a group I have exposure to? Might that have an impact on my stock? What is the news that is driving that stock? Is it material? Which groups are strong/weak? Are there any stocks from the prior day that looked attractive? Did I set alerts so that I am notified when a trade sets up? Have I set alerts on the stocks I have a position in to alert me if they are going higher or lower? Were there any earnings releases after the close the prior day or before the open that might be of interest? </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Recent_Performance">Recent Performance</h2>
<p>How have I been trading recently? Am I over-extended or under-allocated? Should I be looking to reduce risk? Should I be adding to positions? Has my forecasting been accurate? Is there anything from my trade logs that I should be working on? Is there anything I should avoid? What are the most likely scenarios that will play out today? Which scenarios present the best opportunities? How will I know when these scenarios set-up? </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Write_It_Down">Write It Down</h2>
<p>I’ve found it very helpful to conduct all of this analysis and then to write down my game plan. You can create a table with checkboxes, but writing things out is better. If you write in great detail, you can comment on how you did after hours in your trade log. I still write out the game plan for members in the chat room and they come in the form of my pre-open market comments. In the early stages of your trading journey, I highly suggest that you do this. Start your day early and prepare. When the opening bell rings, you need to be alert and ready.</p>
<p>NFL quarterback Tom Brady is the first one to show up each day and he is the last one to leave. He is rested, mentally alert and well-prepared. He studies before, during and after the game. He knows which match-ups favor success and which ones to avoid. When opportunity arises, he executes. You need to do the same.</p>
