<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If the market is dull, keep yourself busy. The work you do now will set you up with future trading opportunities.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>There are about 250 trading days during a calendar year and half of them are dull. Learning how to identify low probability trading environments (LPTE) is important and we have to handle them with care. Choosing not to trade them is typically best, but that does not mean that you sit around idle waiting for a trade to fall into your lap. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Search_For_Opportunities">Search For Opportunities </h2>
<p>Great traders are always searching for opportunities. They are flipping charts in search of a trade. Even though the market is not doing much, a particular stock or a group could be “hot.” These stocks won’t have a market tailwind, but they won’t have to fight a market headwind either. If the checkboxes are marked, great traders will size down and make money on a nice opportunity that lazy traders missed. During the process, they will spot key price points for many stocks (trendlines, horizontal support and resistance, gaps… ) that might not be in play now, but that will be in the future. They take time to draw alert lines or to set alerts that will trigger when technical indicators confirm the move. When market conditions improve, they will get alerts left and right at those key price points. </p>
<p>Even if the day is not conducive for day trading, there could be potential swing trades that are attractive. If the market has been in a strong uptrend, you might be looking for longer term ITM calls to buy. If the market has been in a trading range, there might be some nice bullish put spreads that you can find. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Try_New_Ideas">Try New Ideas</h2>
<p>Experiment and try new ideas. Perhaps you have been using an alert variable with a particular time frame. See if another variable or time frame might work better. Set those alerts and see what happens. Create new Custom Searches. Why might this search be better? Are there market conditions where this search would be particularly useful? </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Work_On_Your_Game_Plan">Work On Your Game Plan</h2>
<p>Game plan for the week ahead. What are the scheduled news events that might impact the market? How has the market reacted to these releases previously? Are there any big earnings releases? Do you have positions in any of those stocks or a position in a company from that group? Do your positions need any adjustments? How will you be positioned into that news? What is the worst case scenario and how will you react?</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Review_Your_Trade_Logs">Review Your Trade Logs</h2>
<p>Review your trade logs. This is tedious work and after a long day of trading, sometimes you don’t have the energy/interest to do it. I prefer to do it after the close when the trades are still fresh in my mind, but there is no harm doing it during normal trading hours. What did you do well? What did you miss? Is there something you can improve on? </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Study_Price_Action">Study Price Action</h2>
<p>Study the price action of SPY M5 and 1OP. In Option Stalker Pro on M5, you can hit the Home button on your keyboard and it will send you back in time. Click forward bar-by-bar until you hit an inflection point or a key bar. What did the price action up until that point tell you? Should you be expecting a reversal? Take a stand and then click forward to see if you were right. No peeking. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Look_For_News">Look For News</h2>
<p>Look for news sources that you can use during your pre-open market analysis. I prefer raw news so that I can read the article and draw my own conclusions. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Spend_Time_Learning">Spend Time Learning</h2>
<p>Read books, the WIKI, The System and watch trading videos. Search the OneOption archives. They are packed with lessons from the chat room. A team of members collect those lessons and you will find some real “gems.” There is always something to learn. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stay_Out_Of_Chat_Rooms">Stay Out Of Chat Rooms</h2>
<p>Stay out of chat rooms! Of course, the OneOption chat room is the exception because we don’t allow casual conversations. Our goal is to only post information that is going to help you now. If you are posting to chat rooms, you are not focused. Who are the people you are communicating with? Are they in a position to make you a better trader? Will they be around in a year? Chances are… no! Good traders are focused on finding great trades, especially during market hours. They are not posting in chat rooms. If there is someone that you really respect as a trader, I will bet you that they don’t post much during market hours. I know that trading can get lonely at times, but you can go into those rooms after hours to get your “social fix.” If you are in these rooms when the market is moving, you will never make it as a trader. Your entire focus should be on finding trades and managing your positions. Time spent debating with “FOMO Joe” on which indicator is better is time wasted and you will never get it back.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Trading is a tough profession. It is not something that you can ever perfect. Pros are constantly looking for new trade ideas, new methods, new sources of information and ways to improve their performance. If you are passionate about trading, no one will have to motivate you to do all of the things I’ve mentioned. You will do it on your own and a few hours after the close of a dull day, you will wonder where the time went. Stay engaged! </p>
