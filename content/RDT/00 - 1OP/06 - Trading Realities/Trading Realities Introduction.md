<p>If you are new to trading and you still have capital, let me start with the biggest mistake you can make. If your win rate is less than 75%, trim your size to 1 share until you reach that level for a few months. Trading is not easy and anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. Learning how to trade takes time and until you master it you want to keep your “tuition” low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section we will discuss some of the realities of trading. Here are a few of the topics: under capitalization, not keeping a trade log, following someone else’s trades, oversizing, unrealistic expectations, no game plan and over confidence. The list of topics is long.</p>
<p>In this section you’ll learn the trials and tribulations of becoming a trader.</p>
