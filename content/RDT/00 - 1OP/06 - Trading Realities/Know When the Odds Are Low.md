<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Often the best trades are the ones you don’t take.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Throughout this course, I discuss the importance of context. I am going to reference shorter-time frames on SPY for day traders, but these same principles apply to longer time frames. The market drives our trading and it is critically important to understand how today’s puzzle piece fits into the longer-term narrative. </p>
<p>There are about 250 trading days in a year and most of them are dull. The context of the current session is going to set your expectations and you will build your game plan around the most likely scenarios. The mistake traders make is that they treat every market day the same as the previous day. When a novice trader has a very profitable day, they expect to repeat that performance the next day. They extrapolate this out over a month and then a year. With this level of performance, they will solve the national debt in a decade. Unfortunately, all of that money they made under the best of conditions will quickly be given back.</p>
<p>A low probability trading environment (LPTE) needs to be handled with care. This is when we reduce our trade count and our trade size. If you fail to recognize this condition and you fail to adjust your trading, you will squander all of the hard earned money you’ve made. In this article, I will discuss some of the things you should watch for. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Inside_Day">Inside Day</h2>
<p>The prior day high/low is the first minor resistance/support respectively. If the market can’t move through those levels it is likely to be an “Inside Day.” If the market breaks out of that range in the first hour of trading, it has a chance to keep going. If not, the prior high and prior low will be more difficult to breach. This is a sign that you should trim your trade count and trade size. Within the market we will often find a “hot” stock or a “hot” group. The good news is that you will not have to worry about the market rug getting pulled out from under you. The bad news is that you will not have a market tailwind and the stock will have to do all of the “heavy lifting.” </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Big_Prior_Day_Move">Big Prior Day Move</h2>
<p>It is rare to see back-to-back big moves. If the market moved more than 1.5 times its 20-day average true range the prior day, there is a good chance the current session is going to be an “Inside Day” and the market is going to take a rest. If you look at a daily chart of SPY, you will notice that there are not many long candles stacked consecutively. Before the open you understand this and you build this into your game plan. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Major_Pending_News">Major Pending News</h2>
<p>The market will often pause before a big event. It could be an FOMC statement, a big economic release, a major round of earnings releases, an election result or a debt ceiling agreement. This is a binary event and often the market will swing one way or the other after the news. If the expected impact is huge, traders will wait for the reaction. This means you keep your trading to a minimum the day before. The worst thing you can do is to force trades. You enter poorly and the stock moves against you. Now you are stuck in the trade. You want to keep your overnight exposure to a minimum so you exit the trade for a loss. Recognizing that the day was likely to be dull might have kept you out of the trap. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Summer_Doldrums">Summer Doldrums</h2>
<p>August is typically a very slow month. The Fed is in recess and politicians are on holiday. The action dies down and traders take vacations before the kids head back to school. Earnings season winds down and we enter a “news vacuum.” This is a time to tread very cautiously. Here is an exercise you can conduct. How many trades did you do in August? Did you make money? How does that month compare to other months? Chances are it was subpar, so this year plan to take some time off in August. Eliminate the temptation to trade, recharge your battery and prepare for a busy fall. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Holidays">Holidays</h2>
<p>As you look ahead, be aware of exchange holidays. The action will die down the day before and the day after the holiday. Build this likely scenario into your game plan. Instead of looking for reasons to trade, you are focused on reasons not to trade. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Longer_Term_Compression">Longer-Term Compression</h2>
<p>If the market is trapped in a longer-term range, the price action will compress. You will see mixed overlapping candles and in general, the volume will decline. Buyers and sellers are in agreement and that means that the intraday price action is also likely to be dull. After a big market move that has lasted for weeks, the market will often compress and digest gains. This condition might have lasted months and the 60-day high and low have been the same for a long time. You could also see price compression after a big move. Tiny bodied candles with wicks and tails form on the D1 chart. This tells you that the market is digesting the recent move. It tests both sides during the day, but it closes near the opening price. Once the market is in a pattern, it tends to continue that pattern. Build this into your trading plan. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Long_Mixed_Overlapping_M5_Candles">Long Mixed Overlapping M5 Candles</h2>
<p>This is a sign of indecision. If the volume is low, the action will be very choppy and you will not have a clear sense of direction. Buy and sell programs are driving the action. If the volume is heavy, there is a good chance that one side or the other will prevail during the day. Set alerts at the high of the day and the low of the day and don’t try to guess the direction. A breakout early in the day needs to have immediate “escape velocity” or the risk of getting sucked back into the range increases. Keep your trading to a minimum until you have technical confirmation and immediate follow through on a breakout. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Low_Volume">Low Volume</h2>
<p>A low volume “Inside Day” is a low probability trading environment. Error on the side of not trading. However, a low volume “Outside Day” can often turn into a trend day. If the price action is orderly and steady in one direction, it can be traded. If it is contra to the longer term D1 trend, you have to be careful. Don’t get trapped in a bad day trade. You don’t want to hold that position overnight since you are on the wrong side of the longer-term market trend. If the light volume breakout favors the longer-term trend, you could have a nice trading opportunity. Often, the momentum during the day builds and the volume starts to increase. If a nice trend is established, you might even consider holding a few “overnights.”</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Every market day is different so you need to trade it differently. The longer-term context will help you to frame the current day. How does today’s puzzle piece fit into the longer-term picture? Look ahead for these patterns and events and incorporate these potential dead spots into your trading game plan. </p>
<p>Your goal is not to trade, your goal is to make money. You are the professional Black Jack player counting cards and you need to vary your bet. When the odds favor you, increase your bet. When the odds are against you, bet small. </p>
