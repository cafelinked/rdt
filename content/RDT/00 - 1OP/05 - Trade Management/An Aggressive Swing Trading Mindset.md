<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There will be moments when you are in an explosive move. You will be tempted to take early profits and you will be disappointed when you do. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>These opportunities will represent less than 5% of your trades, but they have the potential to fund your retirement if you trade them properly. At some point you are going to take a starter position when a stock breaks out. Initially, the move looks pretty normal so I am not talking about trading big earnings related gaps. This is a normal breakout through resistance and the move is going to gain momentum and ultimately rocket higher. You will see D1 stacked candles with little overlap, immediate follow through and massive volume. When you get these super powerful moves, it is important to know what’s fueling the stock. In order for the move to continue, it has to be a material event. Something has changed the long-term growth prospects for the company. The news could brew for months before the theme gains acceptance. The concept does not have to immediately produce profits, but the potential has to be so significant that it changes perception. These themes are transformational and they will change society. Let me give you a few examples of situations where stocks have gone parabolic. </p>
<p>Normally, I don’t like to hold stocks over earnings, but if I deem this to be truly transformational, this is the exception. The news is so incredible and the strength in the stock is undeniable. Valuations no longer matter, it is all about perception and in the eyes of large institutions, the sky is the limit. The company could miss earnings estimates and it won’t matter. They might not even make money or have a plan to monetize the model and it won’t matter. It sounds incredible, but I’ve seen this movie many times. </p>
<p>First of all, the move starts out like a normal breakout. All resistance has been obliterated and the stock climbs straight up a wall. Once it goes parabolic, the move is easy to spot on a stock and that train has left the station. The key is to get in early. In the late 1990’s, the internet was the big craze. Many companies just had to put .com into their press releases and discuss the growth potential for their online business. No one could gauge how profitable the internet was going to be or when those profits would be realized, they just “knew” the internet was going to be big (and it was). This unknown upside fuels the move and some of the projections are outrageous. Then the feeding frenzy sets in. During the “.com bubble,” these analysts were deemed to be “visionaries” because of the returns they were generating. Some of them even went so far as to discredit Warren Buffet’s “old” investing methods because he wasn’t generating 50% annual returns like they were. His valuation models no longer worked in “the new online world.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stories_To_Illustrate">Stories To Illustrate</h2>
<p>Before I continue, I have a couple of fun stories. In 2000, I was speaking at a large conference and an attendee came up to ask me a question after my presentation. He asked me a “hypothetical” question. “What if I work for a company and I own stock in the company or if I will have stock options coming to me in the future. The stock has run up incredibly and I want to lock in those gains. How would I go about doing that? I told him he should buy LEAP puts and to select a strike price that matches the level of protection he would like to have. I mentioned that if he had inside information or if he was an officer of the company he needs to disclose his intentions internally. He said none of that applied, he just was happy with where the stock was and if he locked in those gains, he could retire. He was in his 30’s. Two years later I was speaking at the same conference and he came up to me. He refreshed my memory and he thanked me profusely. I asked him how work was going and he said he had to leave the firm. It turns out that he returned to work and told his colleagues about the strategy to lock in the current stock price. They all scoffed at the idea. “The company was doing great and this stock was going to the moon!” He bought LEAP puts and no one else did. The stock fell from $160 down to $1 in the next two years. Everyone at work was so jealous that the work environment became toxic. He had to resign and he retired with the money he made. I didn’t know it when we first spoke, but the company was Harmonic, Inc. (HLIT). </p>
<p>The second story was from the same time period and it also had a bittersweet ending. I had created a very large options order desk for retail customers. All orders had to be placed verbally back then. We would keep the customer on hold while we called down to the floor and got a fill. One of our customers loved trading. He had a small account ($10K) and he would make a little money and then give it back. This was more of a hobby for him and back then real-time quotes were hard to get so he would often call to get quotes. When it wasn’t busy we would chat with customers so we got to know them. We hadn’t heard from him in a while, but that was common since traders would come and go. One day we got a call from his wife. She told us that her husband had passed over a year ago after being ill and she needed to close the account. When we brought it up there was one position. It was worth over $1.2 million! We couldn’t believe it so we double checked to make sure it wasn’t an error. It was real!! Before he passed, he bought some way out of the money LEAP calls on QCOM. The stock ran up so much in two years that there were multiple stock splits along the way and these options were deep in the money. When we gave her the news, she cried. This was life changing for her. The only bitter part of the story is that he never got to witness the best trade of his life. To be fair, he also didn’t have a chance to screw it up. We all would have done that by taking gains too early. </p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed these stories, but there is a point to them. When a stock goes parabolic, the gains will be much greater than you could have ever expected, and when the highs are in, the backside can be very nasty. The key is being able to identify the reason for the move and then to ride it out until you see the first signs of a top. Stocks can go parabolic both ways (up and down).</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Catalysts_Short_Squeezes">Catalysts &amp; Short Squeezes</h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier that stocks that have parabolic rallies need a catalyst. If there isn’t any material news, it could simply be a short squeeze. Game Stop (GME) would be one example and these trades are extremely dangerous because there is no substance behind the move. You can use the same method I am going to describe, but you should not be trading size when it is a short squeeze. Other stock examples and themes from the past include electric vehicles (TSLA), online social media (FB/META), search engines (GOOG), cell phones (AAPL), crypto currencies and new drugs (i.e. cancer vaccines). The current “disruptive technology” is artificial intelligence and I believe Nvidia (NVDA) is a stock to own. </p>
<p>The greater the perceived potential, the more likely the stock is to go parabolic. That’s because there is no way to quantify how transformative it will be, how widely accepted it will be, what other possible uses there might be for it or how much people will be willing to pay for it. All investors know is that “This is going to be big!”</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the pattern. In both cases (up or down), there will be an initial breakout. Just the way we like it, there will be long candles on heavy volume. There could be another long candle the next day or it might take a few days. There is very little retracement into the first breakout candle. That is a sign that the move is legitimate and that it is just starting. </p>
<p>It’s time to take a deep breath. You are buying this breakout and you feel it is going to gain traction. Great, that is how we should feel about all breakouts. Realize that “disruptive technology” is rare and that parabolic moves are rare. A new whitening agent for a toothpaste manufacturer is NOT transformative. You know the potential for these moves so you will try to find them everywhere. Beware, they are not common!</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Common_Mistakes">Common Mistakes</h2>
<p>This is where most traders/investors make the first mistake. They buy a breakout and the move gains immediate traction. They don’t know the catalyst and this is just like every other trade. Instead of adding to the position, they are deciding where they should be taking gains. They’ve already made a lot of money. If the stock is climbing a wall and stacking green candles, it is going to go higher! How do I know? That price action is a sign of aggressive buying by institutions. There is little to no retracement and the volume is heavy. The news has these long-term investors excited and they are buying everything in sight. The price action is the “tell” and these buyers are looking years ahead. If the stock is not climbing a wall, it is not going to go parabolic. We are not playing Junior Analyst and we not are trying to predict that this new weight loss drug is going to dominate all others. That’s not our job. We are trading the price action that is in front of us and it is telling us the move is real. We want to follow the smart money.</p>
<p>In the first chart, you can see a significant breakout through H- trendlines and the stock is above all of the major moving averages. It is also above AVWAPE and the volume is heavy. The candles are starting to stack and there is immediate follow through. The stock has broken horizontal resistance and it briefly pulled back to test the EMA 8. We want to add to the position, but we want to do it when the EMA 8 catches up. You can see how the test of the EMA 8 results in a bullish hammer.</p>
<p>This is where most traders and investors make the second mistake. Instead of adding to the position, they are in profit taking mode. At this stage, it’s a monster winner. They are excited by the money they’ve made and they do not want it to slip through their fingers. They will take profits and they will feel fantastic… for a few days. The stock will stage the next leg of the rally and they will lament. There is no way that they can mentally re-enter the trade. “Only a fool would buy this stock at these levels. I will wait for a pullback.” The dip never comes and the stock surges higher. They think about how much money they could have made if they had stuck with the original position. Later, I get one of the most common questions, “Pete, how do I know when to sell? I always seem to get out too early.” My answer is always the same. We don’t set predetermined targets. What in the price action told you it was time to exit the trade? The answer is… nothing. The problem was your mindset. Instead of having an aggressive mindset, you had a conservative mindset. Greed was replaced by the fear of giving your profits back. That’s why you got out. You needed to recognize the pattern and you needed to realize the significance of the catalyst that was driving the stock higher.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>This next chart is similar in nature so let’s continue the lesson. There were a couple of missing thoughts that I need to cover. First of all, the trader is only thinking about what they could have made on the initial trade if they had held on. They are not even considering how much more they would have made if they had added to it. Next, there’s the fool who decides that the stock is way too over-extended and that the valuations are outrageous. They short this move while the stock is still climbing. When they have taken a sufficient beating, they will cover and actually fuel the move higher. </p>
<p>Before I start sounding like an “all knowing” genius, I will tell you that this is a very hard lesson to learn and it is even more difficult to execute. Back in the late 1990’s I traded, but passively. Every trade had to be pre-approved by a Compliance Officer. That took time a lot of time and longer-term swing trades were the only trades I could do. They were busy and so was I. When I had a trade on, it was a distraction. Sure I made great money in the late 1990’s, but nothing close to what my customers made. I took gains too early and I was jealous. These people were blindly buying call options on stratospheric stocks and making a killing. Every time I would execute a buy order I felt like I was helping the lambs enter the slaughter house. Given my discipline, there was absolutely, positively no way for me to mentally do these trades and I knew it. I surmised that the only reason they were able to make that kind of money and to buy at those levels was because they had no idea of what they were doing. I knew stocks were over-extended and I knew they were over-valued. With every sell order and every giant gain they made, my envy grew. Everything I had learned during my MBA and everything I knew about trading was invalidated. I knew that eventually, the bottom would fall out and that they would take devastating losses. That moment did not come for a long-time and the move far exceeded everyone’s expectations. </p>
<p>This was a great learning moment for me. The lesson was that I don’t know shit about valuations and that there are times when they just don’t matter. If there is “transformative technology” and “industry disruption,” there is a chance for a parabolic move. The harder it is to quantify profits and future potential, the better. Find these situations and use price as your guide. Instead of having a normal trading mindset, have an aggressive one. Price is truth and it is telling me what the smart money is doing. Don’t worry about playing the “greater fool.” Instead of taking profits, add to the position. I have to admit that I still struggle with the “add to the position” part. I know these set-ups and my way of mentally handling these is to add very quickly when the move is just starting. If the move is a fad or I am uncertain about the potential (pot stocks), I will stay be more vigilant. If it is something I feel will change the future (AI right now) I will take a longer-term position. Instead of a D1 chart, I will pay more attention to the W1 chart. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Profit_Taking">Profit Taking</h2>
<p>Let’s get to the profit taking part of the lesson. You have a lot of money on the line and the gains are racking up quickly. As the move matures, it will accelerate with a buying climax. Long green candles resembling skyscrapers will form. There are no sellers, only buyers. Eventually the stock will hit resistance. Everyone is on “pins and needles” wondering how much higher the stock will run and at what price the warning signs will surface. Typically, the stock will gap up to a new all-time high. During that move, it will be smacked down on extreme volume and stacked red candles. This is an intraday gap reversal and the stock never looks back, not even remotely. There are very few bounces if any during the day. We don’t make swing decisions based on an intraday price action, we wait for confirmation that the stock is going to finish weak. Late in the day, if the likely outcome is a bearish engulfing candle D1, I will take some gains. That will make me feel good and it will decrease my mental stress. I’ve already milked this trade for much more than I ever thought possible. In some cases, the stock might not have gapped up. It could have opened flat, but it surged to a new all-time high during the day and then got slapped down in a similar fashion leaving a bearish hammer on a D1 chart. In either case, this is a sign of heavy selling and it needs to be respected. Unlike a normal mindset where we have longer-term confidence that there will be a lower high double top and an attempt to get back to the previous high, we don’t have that here. When we see selling pressure, we have to take our gains. Very aggressive traders can wait to see if there is follow through selling early the next day. If there is, then you would exit. If the stock bounces, you use the prior close as your stop. If the stock is able to recapture the all-time high in the next few days, you can ride the move. This is the approach I use for the remainder of the position. The hour is late and the profits are huge. Be in profit taking mode when you see this and don’t worry about the upside until you do. Along the way, there will be plenty of little head fake dips that are instantly gobbled up. Those dips are great because they prove that buyers are still aggressive when they are erased. They are confirmation that the stock is going higher. The reason for the dip is that there are profit takers along the way who can’t “take the heat.” If your trading time frame is 6+ months out, use a D1 chart. If your time frame is greater than a year, you might opt for a W1 chart when you are looking for your exit. Realize that W1 parabolic moves are quite rare. Match the time frame for the bearish engulf or the bearish hammer to your trade duration. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Quick_Recap">Quick Recap</h2>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The breakout comes on a long green candle closing on its high. Major (if not all) resistance levels have been breached and there are “blue skies” ahead. </li>
<li>The volume is massive.</li>
<li>There is transformative news that will change the industry or society.</li>
<li>If this news is not unique to a company, find the best stock in the sector/group. If you are uncertain which stock will be the leader, spread out across a few of those stocks. Look for the stock with the best relative strength in the group or the largest market share.</li>
<li>There is instant follow through with more stacked candles. </li>
<li>Add early in the move and prepare mentally to ride the trade. </li>
<li>There are no early long red candles in the move. They don’t exist because long-term buyers are gobbling up everything they can. </li>
<li>The potential for the company seems limitless. “How can anyone put a number on this?”</li>
<li>Don’t play Junior Analyst. You don’t know shit. Price is truth.</li>
<li>The move climbs like a hot air balloon. This is not your normal 45-degree chart. </li>
<li>Be aggressive and stay the course. Know that once you exit, your brain will not let you re-enter. Dispel the notion that you will re-enter on a dip, there won’t be any. The future price will be much higher, not lower. You already hit the panic button once and you have no staying power if you re-enter. Once you hit the sell button, the trade is over.</li>
<li>Watch for a D1 bearish engulfing candle or a bearish hammer off of the all-time high. At minimum, take gains on half of the position. If the stock trades below the prior close the next day, exit the remainder. If the stock bounces, place a stop at the prior day low. You need the stock to recover the bearish candle in a few days. If it can’t, take gains. If it does, use this same exit method described here for the remainder and watch for those bearish candles off of a new high.</li>
<li>Do not wait for a lower high double top. You were mentally aggressive on the way up and once you have the warning signs, you need to be mentally aggressive taking profits. </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Parabolic_Drops">Parabolic Drops</h2>
<p>Parabolic moves also happen on the downside. There’s an old adage that “the market takes the stairs up and the elevator down.” The same is true for stocks. Positive transformational themes take time to gain acceptance and we have time to monitor and watch the companies that will benefit. That is not the case with parabolic moves lower. They tend to happen much faster. When there’s “blood in the water,” institutions tend to “shoot first and ask questions later.” </p>
<p>Parabolic drops are typically caused by changes in the macro business conditions. A new competitor or technology could disrupt an entire industry. New regulations could make it harder for the company to make money. Perhaps previous expectations (valuations) for the company were too high and the company is struggling to monetize this new technology (no one is willing to pay for it). There could also be fraud and the books were “cooked” (Enron). Perhaps there are civil lawsuits (tobacco). There could also be macro-economic conditions that spark investor fear (2008 Financial Crisis or Covid). Regardless of the reason, the bottom is falling out of the stock. </p>
<p>Given that the market is flat to higher more than 80% of the time, I tend to favor parabolic rallies over parabolic drops. That’s because they take longer to play out and they are uplifting. When the bottom is falling out of a stock or a sector/group, I know that people’s lives are impacted. During the financial crisis, there were some incredible shorts, but we were on the verge of a collapse. People were worried… I was worried. I was making money, but the future was very uncertain. </p>
<p>When the stock breaks technical support, it will do so with ease. There will be instant follow through with stacked consecutive red candles and you won’t see any bounces. The volume will be extreme. Understand what’s driving the stock down. Find out why institutions are selling the stock. Enter early and add early. This is more important for shorting because the move will accelerate quickly and put IVs will explode quickly. Then, stay the course and let the move play out. Don’t exit until you see a bullish engulfing candle or a bullish hammer off of a new low. I am a more anxious profit taker on parabolic moves lower. The bounces tend to be just as violent as the drop and the market tends to go up more than it goes down. You are typically trading against the longer-term market trend. The company is going to calm investors and there might be share repurchases. Short squeezes are also common. If you are long puts, you will benefit from exploding option IVs so you want to take profits at the first sign of support. Once the stock stops going down, the option IVs will contract. If the stock bounces, the IVs will implode. You want to capture as much of those high IVs as you can. </p>

<p>Parabolic moves start out like a normal move. The theme is transformative and it could be a “disruptive technology” or a new discovery. It will take time for the idea to gain traction, but once it does, it will catch fire quickly. If the theme has the potential to change society or an industry well into the future, it has the key element. The company does not have to make money on the concept, it just has to be at the forefront and it needs to have an edge to exploit it before competitors enter. For instance, Facebook had critical mass (huge user base) well before it made money. We are not looking for companies that gap up or down after earnings. That’s not what this is about. In fact, companies that fit this mold can miss earnings badly and it won’t matter. All that matters is that the potential to make big profits in the future is there. The key is to identify the theme early and to get on board early. When you have price confirmation, add to the position quickly before it starts to “climb the wall.” Mentally prepare to ride the stock higher until you see a bearish hammer or a bearish engulfing candle off of a new all-time high. Know that once you are out, you are out for good. Even if you don’t catch the absolute high, this strategy will lock in gains beyond your wildest expectations. </p>
<p>If you only trade the best of the best that I outlined in <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/trade-management/the-right-swing-trading-mindset/">The Right Swing Trading Mindset</a> and you catch a few of these along the way, you won’t need anything else. Stop trading choppy stocks.</p>
