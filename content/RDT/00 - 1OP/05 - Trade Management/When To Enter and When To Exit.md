<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There’s an old trading adage that says you can’t go broke taking profits. That might be true, but you’ll never make it as a Pro if you do that. You need to milk that trade for all its got.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>I am a stickler for good entries. When your timing is right, the trade is much easier to manage. The same process we use on the way in is used to exit the trade. One of the most frequently asked questions I get is, “How do I know when to enter and exit?” This is an important topic, so let’s dive in. I am likely to point to this article every time this question comes up. </p>
<p>Our mental state impacts our trading and we operate in an emotional spectrum that ranges from greed to fear. Our desire to make money is balanced by our need to protect what we have. Our confidence in the trade determines where we are in that spectrum. The more checkboxes we mark, the higher our level of confidence. If we wait for the best windows of opportunity, our odds of success will increase. Ultimately, our desire to make money and our confidence in the set up allows us to enter the trade. If we enter the trade well, it will perform right away and we will have some cushion. We could place a stop at our entry price. Then we would have no downside risk and lots of upside. I don’t do this, but for many traders this is a comforting thought. Entering well removes some of the emotion. Why was our confidence so high when we entered the trade? </p>
<p>In a previous article I discussed the importance of a <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/trade-management/a-good-game-plan-increases-your-odds/">Game Plan</a>. We gather information and we set our expectations of what we believe is going to happen, what we would like to have happen and what we would not like to have happen. Based on all of the information we determine which scenarios are most likely. This entire process happens instantly and it determines our level of confidence. There is no substitute for experience and your skill improves over time. The market is dynamic and the more conditions you are exposed to, the better you’ll get. This is not something that you can master instantly so be patient. Let’s look at an example and let’s start from the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Gather_Your_Market_Bearings">Gather Your Market Bearings </h2>
<p>Market First! As of this writing, the market has been in an incredible up trend. In the last two months of the year, it rallied almost 10%. There were no dips and every red candle was instantly gobbled up by buyers the next day. It is above all of the major moving averages and it is above AVWAPQ. It is also “one good day” from the all-time high. It has been able to digest the recent gains and earnings season is about to start. That could very well be the catalyst that sends us to a new all-time high. My D1 market confidence is VERY high and I am bullish (10 out of 10). Keep in mind I won’t always have this level of confidence. I am adding to bullish swing trades and I am looking for bullish day trading opportunities. Let’s focus on the bullish day trading opportunities and take the next step in this analysis. </p>

<p>Market First! I already know that I like the D1 chart, but what does the market look like today (1/12/24)? The first week of the year we saw a small round of profit taking. We were expecting that and we were also expecting the dip to be brief and shallow because of the D1 market strength. Buyers are still engaged. They came in with a vengeance Monday and they gobbled up everything in sight. The entire dip during the first week of the year was engulfed in one day (long green candle) and the market has drifted higher the rest of the week. The “hotter” than expected CPI Thursday could have sparked more profit taking, but the market finished near the high of the day and near the high from 2023. That was confirmation that buyers were not deterred by one “hot” reading yesterday. </p>
<p>This morning, bank stocks kicked off earnings season and financial stocks have been on an absolute tear the last two months. I am not expecting these stocks to move much one way or the other after earnings. Good news is priced in and banks will deliver good results. The backdrop for bank profits for Q1 is also intact. Interest rates will remain “higher for longer” and people have jobs so they can pay back loans. The early indication is that bank stocks will hold up well and they are mixed after posting results. The market is going to gap higher, but we are not going to chase the open. The SPY is testing the high from 2023 (resistance) and we have a bearish 1OP cross pending M5. The game plan is to evaluate the SPY during the bearish cycle and to look for the strongest stocks during that cycle. While the bearish cycle runs, we would like to see the gap hold. If it doesn’t, it tells us the selling pressure is a little heavier and we will have to patiently wait for signs of support. We don’t want the SPY to probe too much below the close from Thursday. A drop of that magnitude would be a sign of heavier selling. On the way down we want to see mixed overlapping candles. That will indicate that buyers are still active and that each move lower is challenged. Stacked consecutive red candles with little to no retracement would be a sign of heavy selling pressure especially if the volume is heavy. That would keep us sidelined for a couple of hours. We will also keep an eye on XLF since banks reported this morning. Do you see how we are setting our expectations? We know exactly what we are looking for and exactly how that will impact our decision making process. </p>

<p>As the trading day unfolds, we are constantly gathering and processing information on the market. The candles were mixed and overlapping and we are filling the gap. It would have been more bullish if the gap were preserved because it would have told us that buyers were fairly aggressive. The 1OP bearish cycle produced. Mixed overlapping candles on the way down were a sign that buyers were present. The volume was light and that was a sign that the market might not go far in either direction. It found support just below the prior close. The gap was filled and a bullish 1OP cross was pending. This is where we should see signs of support. Off of the low of the day we saw a green bullish engulfing candle. It had follow through so this was an entry point for long starter positions. The gap reversal was wimpy and it bought us time to find stocks with relative strength. Our M5 confidence in an SPY bounce was at a 5 at this stage. That means we will trade smaller size and only the strongest stocks will do. We won’t have to worry about the market rug getting pulled out today, but we also won’t have much of a tailwind. The stock will have to do all of the heavy lifting. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Find_The_Best_Of_The_Best">Find The Best Of The Best</h2>
<p>META was the stock that I highlighted during the live event Wednesday. I love this D1 chart. The stock is above AVWAPE, through a High+ D1, it is above all of the major moving averages, it broke out to a new relative high, it has relative strength D1 and the volume is heavy. Yesterday the stock dropped with the market after the “hot” CPI, but it clawed its way back all day and it recovered all of the losses for the day and it closed near its high of the day. This was confirmation that buyers were still interested. They tested the bid and the stock roared back. That left a bullish hammer on the D1 chart. Our D1 confidence in the stock should be a 10. The stock confirmed support and it wants to move higher. </p>

<p>So, what did META do during the market pullback today? The stock had great relative strength and decent volume. During the market pullback it wanted to keep going higher and it was right at the high of the day when the market showed signs of support. This stock is poised to make a new high of the day if the market bounces. As far as the M5 for the stock our confidence should be a 10. We are still not that confident in the SPY M5 price action so this will be a starter position. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/meta011524a-1024x897.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="f6fcac39-25fb-42a2-b9a6-1a47e64ed42d">

                    </div>
                
<p>The market staged a nice bounce and we expected META to participate. It had been strong to this point and buyers were going to get more aggressive now that the market was moving higher. META did make a new high of the day and that was nice. However, the market probed for support once more. This was not a major concern since the SPY price action to this point had been bearish and the mixed candles told us that the selling pressure would not be very sustained. During this SPY bid check, the stock would have to pass another “test” and we would be able to observe how it handled this little market drop. META had been a little choppy so we should have expected a small pullback. Given the early price action in the stock, the VWAP will provide support and when the market finds support, the stock will lift off and make a new high for the day. The market retest was over and the SPY made a higher low double bottom M5. That was great and it confirmed support. Unfortunately, the stock traded below VWAP. That selling pressure was NOT what we expected. Furthermore, when the market bounced, the stock continued to drift lower. Now our M5 confidence in META would have dropped to a 5. There is no way we would be adding to this starter position. META needed to recover quickly during this market bounce and if it did not, we would be looking for a good exit. </p>

<p>As the action unfolded, the market did continue to grind higher. This was the moment we were waiting for and it was time for META buyers to flex their muscles. As the market moved higher, META did not participate. It compressed just above the VWAP and it was not able to advance. The volume had also dried up. We should still be willing to hold on to the position, but our confidence in META M5 would take a hit (2). 1OP for SPY had a bearish cross later in the day. The market price action had been choppy all day so there was a good chance that the bearish cycle would produce. This is a very important point. If the market price action had been bullish all day, we could have held the position on the notion that and dip would be minor and that META could still regain its footing. That was not the case here. The market was likely to dip. META did not participate in the market rally and the volume dried up. There was no reason to think that META was going to defy the market during this dip. It was time to exit the trade. The checkboxes that were marked earlier in the day are no longer valid. Our confidence in the stock moving higher was low and our desire to preserve capital was greater than our desire to make money.</p>
<p>Notice how our expectations for the market and for the stock were determined before the trading day started. We knew the backdrop and we had a very high level of confidence in the market D1 and the stock D1. That did not mean that this was all going to transfer over to the M5 for either one of them. We evaluated the price action for the market and we evaluated the price action for the stock during the day. Those observations set our expectations for what the market was going to do and what the stock was going to do intraday. We did not have pre-determined price levels where we would enter the trade and we did not have pre-determined levels where we were going to take profits or where we were going to set our stops. We were going to let the action unfold. If we got the market move we expected and the stock move we expected, we were going to stay in the trade and possibly add to it. If we did not get the market move we expected or the stock move we expected, we had to adjust our thinking and we had to consider exiting the trade. Let’s take a look at another stock during the same period of time. </p>

<p>IBM had been popping up on our searches Friday morning. This stock was not on our radar prior to that, but the D1 was excellent. The stock was breaking out through a minor High- trendline and a bullish flag was forming. The stock had relative strength D1 and the volume was heavy today. It was above all of the major moving averages, it was above AVWAPE and the volume was heavy. As previously discussed, our market confidence D1 was at 10, our market confidence M5 was a 5 and for IBM our D1 confidence was also a 10. Now we just had to gauge the stock’s performance M5.</p>

<p>IBM gapped up and it was above the prior day high. The volume was heavy and during the early market decline and the stock continued to drift higher. Our confidence for IBM on an M5 basis was at a 10. We just had to wait for the market to find support. As I discussed earlier, the SPY move lower was not that powerful. It featured mixed overlapping candles with lots of retracement. The bullish engulfing candle at the low of the day for SPY along with support at the prior close and a bullish 1OP cross was enough for us to take a starter long position. IBM had been defying gravity and with a market tailwind it should make a new high for the day. </p>

<p>The stock participated in the market bounce and it made a new high for the day. Unlike META, when the market probed for support once more, IBM did not retrace. The volume remained strong and it retained its relative strength. The market made a higher low double bottom so our market confidence was higher than when we entered the trade. The stock did exactly what we expected it to. IBM made a new high for the day and it was time to add to the position. </p>

<p>In the afternoon it was apparent that IBM was on a mission. It continued to make new highs for the day, the volume remained heavy, it retained its relative strength and it was oblivious to what the market was doing. Our confidence was high for the SPY D1, the Stock D1 and the Stock M5. The only weak point was our confidence in the market M5. We suspected that the pending bearish SPY 1OP cross might produce some selling, but the stock had been oblivious to the market all day. This was a sign that buyers were active. We did not want to give back our gains, so we should set a price level that we would like to see preserved. That price level could have been the open of the Key Bar or the high from the compression. Any technical support level would do. As long as that price level held, we were prepared to weather the market pullback. </p>

<p>During the market decline, IBM did not flinch. It preserved all of its gains and the volume remained heavy. The market found support at a higher low and IBM looked poised to advance. This is where we would add to the position. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Confidence_Is_Key">Confidence Is Key</h2>
<p>The key to trading is confidence. It is what allows us to enter the trade. The more checkboxes we mark, the higher our odds of success and the more confident we are in the trade. We determine our market confidence D1. This is a painstaking part of the process because we have a lot of information to gather and we need to be aware of the influences, scheduled events and the price action. We won’t always have a high level of confidence for the market D1. In 2022, we were seeing big moves in both directions. There will also be times when our D1 market confidence is high, but it might not be directional. We might be very confident that the market is going to remain in a trading range. That would keep us neutral (not bullish or bearish). The next step is to gather all of the overnight information and to conduct scenario analysis. We don’t know what the market will do, but often we can assess which outcomes are most likely and which ones we would favor. We also visualize the price action that would confirm which scenario is actually playing out. This preparation allows us to be proactive. Ultimately, we will determine an M5 level of confidence for the market. Our market forecast D1 and M5 and our confidence in that forecast drives all of our trading decisions. It determines our position sizing and our options strategies. </p>
<p>Once we get our market bearings, we find the best stocks. Our D1 confidence in the stock should always be a 10. There are thousands of fantastic stocks that have relative strength and there is no reason to ever compromise on the D1 chart. During the day the stock searches help us find the best stocks. Our custom column layouts are also very helpful and we can pin point the best of the best. We compare what the stock is doing M5 to what the SPY is doing M5. If the stock is strong relative to the SPY and if the volume is heavy and the price action is orderly, we have the right vehicle. We set up our expectations for the market and for the stock. As long as both are performing, we stay the course. If either changes we adjust. The same evaluation that got us in the trade is used to determine if we should add to the position, take gains or stop out. It is not static or mechanical, it is dynamic. We are trading the market, but we are riding the fastest horse. That is our edge.</p>
<p>Our confidence in our analysis and our desire to make money prompts us to take a trade. Our ongoing analysis once we enter the trade determines our confidence to stay in the trade. Eventually, our confidence will wane and our desire to preserve capital (take gains or cut losses) will prevail. That is when we exit the trade. It is not determined by how much money we made/lost, but by our confidence. Changing conditions impact our confidence. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f00MuhQVPFU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In this video</a>, you can watch me go through the entire process with the stocks we used. </p>
<p>Let me conclude with an analogy. “Mr. Brady, how do you know when to attempt a pass and when to throw the ball out of bounds?” Think of all of the variables he would need to consider. Would you expect a simple answer? He processes information, he checks boxes, he assesses risk, he makes a decision and he acts. This decision is not determined before the snap. Every snap is unique and this is an ongoing process during the entire game. When it comes to football, people can appreciate how difficult it would be to answer this question.
