<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Your mental state is determined by your confidence and your confidence is driven by context. In this example we are going to look at the “best of the best.” If your stocks don’t look like this… they should!</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Before we get started, let me set the context for this entire article. Most technical analysis books include annotated charts. They find picture-perfect setups and then they write about them: “Here is a classic example of buying a strong trend. The trend is your friend!” As expected, the stock soars and you think about all of the money you could have made buying calls. Hindsight is 20:20 and even a child can find those “perfect” historical examples. The decision to buy and to ride the trade is not as easy as they make it appear. </p>
<p>Let’s say that you bought the stock in the chart below early in the move. Here’s what your mind is telling you. All of the “words of wisdom” you’ve heard are casting doubt and you will be influenced by them. You have money on the line during the trend higher and you are emotional. You’ve made nice gains and you don’t want to see them slip away. I understand… I’ve been there. “Don’t be greedy, don’t chase, be patient, pigs get slaughtered, buy dips…” If you are struggling to trade profitably, these voices will be very loud and you can’t let these gains slip by.</p>

<p>Instead of listening to those “voices in your head,” you need to mute them by conducting ongoing analysis. Along the way, you are picking up clues from the price action on how strong that trend is. The price action is very orderly and tight. There are more green candles than red candles. There are very few retracements and the dips are brief and shallow. The stock has great relative strength, good volume during the rally and it is above all of the major moving averages. These are all signs of aggressive buying and below are the “voices” you need to be listening to. </p>

<p>“Wait, are you telling me you should be buying more even after the stock has run up so much?” Yes! Do you see how your mental state is flipped? We look for signs that the trend might be weakening and there aren’t any. In the first case, you are scared shitless because you don’t want to be the dummy who pushed the trade too hard and who gave back all of the gains. Similar thoughts will keep most you out of the trade in the first place and you would never have taken it. “The stock has run too far.” “I’m not going to chase.” Some of you will wait for the dip that never comes. When the price action is this tight, a compression (pause) might be as good as it gets and that is a sign of incredible strength because all of the gains to that point have been preserved and buyers are still aggressive. When the stock finally does dip, you will convince yourself that the stock has “run too far” and this is the start of a trend reversal. You got the move you were looking for and you did not take action. </p>
<p>“OK Pete, you’ve picked a picture-perfect stock and now you are feeding us BS.” Yes, I did pick a very strong stock to illustrate a point. These negative thoughts will run through your mind. No, I am not feeding you BS. This stock is the “poster child” for the pattern you should be looking for. I see stocks like this every day and if yours don’t look like this, keep looking!! Many of the stock picks I see posted look like garbage. Your job is to predict price movement. Get it right and you will make money. Get it wrong and you will lose money. Do you want to try to predict the flight of a bat or a flock of geese in “V” formation? I know which one I am going to choose. During this course I have been teaching you the price action to look for. This price action gives us the context and the context gives us the confidence to add to a stock that has already moved a great distance. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify_The_Best_Of_The_Best_">Identify The “Best Of The Best”</h2>
<p>The learning process happens in stages, so let me describe them. The first stage is that you’ve identified a stock with a really strong trend. If you are able to consistently identify the “best of the best,” congratulations. Accept no substitutes! At first, you will take a position and you will scalp out of it when you have “enough profit.” Surprisingly, some traders won’t even consider it again. It’s almost as if the stock is toxic and there is no way possible that the same stock can yield another winner. I don’t get this mental block, but I see it all the time. It’s almost as if they need a new challenge to find the next “star.” As traders mature, they recognize this “honey hole” and they revisit it many times on each confirmation (breakout). They scalp in and out of it for small gains. They were nervous the entire way up and that is why they scalped it. By the time the move is over, they have nice gains, but they will realize that they could’ve made a lot more money with a lot less effort if they just held it. Now they will progress to the next stage. They buy the stock early in the move and they fight off the thoughts I’ve mentioned. They milk the move and they resist the temptation to take gains. This time they will wait for signs of selling pressure. They are not going to set predetermined price targets, they are going to ride the move. Congratulations, this is a major accomplishment! The next step of the learning process is to add to the position on the way up. This is a more challenging step and I’ll explain why. It takes experience and your confidence will grow with each winner. </p>
<p>Not all of the charts you see are going to be as strong as the one I’ve selected. They will be excellent, but the dips could be a little more pronounced or the compressions might last longer. There might be more retracements and there might be mixed candles. That doesn’t mean we can’t trade these trends, it just means that we have to treat them with a little more caution, and I will go over some of those patterns in a future article. With regards to the stock I’ve highlighted, here are the prevailing thoughts that allow you to add to the position on the way up… even at the very top. “This is an incredibly strong trend and I know that from the price action. These set-ups are rare and this stock is going higher! If I get a dip, I want it to be brief and shallow. It is likely to turn into a bullish flag and if that happens, I will add.”</p>

                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/anf030324b-1024x844.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="18e55331-57a8-4c5c-9fc0-e2b1877ba822">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Strong_Stocks_Typically_Don_t_Reverse_Sharply">Strong Stocks Typically Don’t Reverse Sharply</h2>
<p>Again, most stocks do not look like this. We know that and all of the checkboxes are marked. The second thought that allows us to add to the position is, “This level of strength does not typically reversed sharply.” Buyers do not all of a sudden decide to pull the plug and bail on the stock. The trend usually ends with a compression. A normal bullish compression will be extremely tight and it won’t last more than a week or two. Those would represent a pause and that is bullish. On a breakout, I will add. The compression that weakens the trend will have longer mixed green and red candles. Buyers and sellers are paired off and that is why we see these longer candles. When we start to see this, we take our gains and now it is time to celebrate a great trade and great trade management. We set alerts at the top and the bottom of the range. If the stock struggles to make a new relative high, it could be a lower high double top and I will take gains. The position is large at this stage because we have been adding on the way up. This compression is likely to take a while to be resolved. The stock could head higher so I will set an alert at the high. The trend could reverse so I will set alerts down below. Until an alert is triggered, I will look for the next prospect. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lower_Average_Costs">Lower Average Costs</h2>
<p>The next thought that allows us to add is, “Our average cost is much lower. If there is a nasty drop, I will be able to exit the trade for a nice gain. I don’t have to panic if I see them. Even if there are a few stacked long red candles off of the high, the stock will bounce.” This is a reassuring thought, but how can I be so sure? I know this from the previous price action. The stock is super, super, super strong. Buyers have been lined up for weeks/months and they have all been waiting for a dip. When they get one, they will buy aggressively. The stock will rally. If it makes a new relative high, that dip will result in a bullish flag. If the stock can’t get through the high, it will form a double top lower high. That will be my sign to exit and that lower high will not be too far from the previous high. “No matter what… I will get that bounce off of the dip and I will get that opportunity to exit the trade at a great price. I do not have to worry about having the rug pulled out and I do not have to worry about all of my gains vaporizing.” Those are your prevailing thoughts. You need to purge this thought. “I’m not going to be the idiot who buys the all-time high and then who has the rug pulled out.”</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>I just know a handful of novices are going to be scratching their heads right now. “Pete, in the chat room you tell us not to buy the high of the day and you tell us not to chase. It sounds like you are telling us that’s OK.” To which I would respond… “Don’t make me come over there!” 1. We are talking about swing trading, not day trading. 2. I am not talking about buying stocks in the first hour of trading. 3. The D1 charts some of you are trading do not look like the stock I am showing you and the M5 does not look like the stock I am showing you. We are not chasing stacked “greens” that look like skyscrapers on volatile stocks. It is imperative that you understand the meaning of nice orderly price action. Now that I have that off of my chest, we can continue.</p>
<p>The context of the rally will indicate how strong the D1 trend is. It will give you the confidence to take a starter position. As the move unfolds, it will confirm strength and it will give you the confidence to stay in the position and to add to it. As the stock moves higher, you will look for signs of exhaustion. If there aren’t any, you will continue to add knowing that bull rallies of this nature “die hard” and that buyers will be looking to buy dips. If a dip is fairly deep (longer red candles than you have seen previously) and the stock can’t recapture the relative high (longer greens and reds), take gains. You won’t be leaving much on the table and you’ve seen signs of selling pressure. Moves with the level of strength of the highlighted stock very rarely reverse sharply. Buyers have been aggressive on the way up and if there was uncertainty surrounding the stock, the price action would not have been as orderly and steady on the way up. Remove any negative thoughts that the stock has run too far or that a big reversal is looming. Work on the process. Only trade stocks that have nice orderly price action and that have relative strength and heavy volume. Instead of scalping in and out, just hold the position and ride it as long as you can. Your next objective will be to add to the position as it confirms trend strength. The context of the move will give you the confidence to do so. </p>
<p>I will conclude on this note. Many traders will settle for inferior chart patterns. “Pete just found a great example, but those set-ups are rare.” That’s not true. In just a few minutes I found many examples and I could post 20 charts below. Do not settle for “sloppy moves.” They will #$%^ up your mental state. As soon as you buy, they retrace. Now you have a loser and you will wonder if this dip will be deeper and last longer than the one before. Once the dip is resolved you will have doubts on whether or not you should add to the position… so you don’t. If you are buying short-term calls, these dips will rob you of time premium. Nice, tight, orderly patterns with a nice trend higher on heavy volume are all that you should trade. Ideally, the stock does not dip, it compresses for a week or two before staging the next leg higher. If it does have dips, they are brief and shallow. The stock is consistently making higher highs and higher lows. I found these charts in two minutes and I even included a bearish one. Only pick stocks with this pattern and it will be much easier to manage the trade mentally. </p>
