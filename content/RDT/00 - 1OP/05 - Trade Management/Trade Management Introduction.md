<p>You have a market opinion and you are confident in it. Now it’s time to find the best stocks and to devise a trading game plan for your entire portfolio and for each individual position. Market conditions change constantly and it’s important to adjust your trading game plan. Sometimes, you will be thrown a curveball and we address that in this section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a sample of the topics we cover: when to take profits, how to hedge, how to nail the entry, how to size the position, and where to place your stops. A well-conceived game plan will keep your emotions in check as you try to stay one step ahead of the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll teach you how to raise your targets when everything is going right and we will teach you how to mitigate your losses when they are not.</p>
