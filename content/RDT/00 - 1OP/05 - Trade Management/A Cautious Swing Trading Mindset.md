<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Your confidence in the trade is determined by context. We’ve discussed the right mindset and the best context. Now let’s take a look at situations that are marginally attractive so that we can set a minimal standard.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>There will be times when the market is not in a strong trend and it is difficult to find stocks that have nice tight orderly price action with a strong trend higher. That is always the preferred swing trading pattern and I covered them in this <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/trade-management/the-right-swing-trading-mindset/">previous article</a>. Your search should be exhausted before you consider trading these “loser tier” stocks. Don’t give up looking, those stocks are out there and they are leading the market higher. Often, traders won’t look hard enough and they will settle for inferior price action. Sometimes they are in “love” with a stock and they will deem it to be “good enough.” The issue at hand is that we are directional traders. We get paid when we properly forecast future price movement. If the price action is choppy, the context is not ideal and it is going to impact your confidence. It’s imperative that you only trade “the best of the best.” Here’s why.</p>
<p>The chart below has a long-term uptrend. If it doesn’t have a trend, why are you looking at it? Trends tell us that long-term money is active. The price action for the stock below is choppy. It has lots of “fits and starts” and the dips are fairly deep and frequent. The candles are mixed and overlapping. When you enter a swing position on a stock like this, you have to wait a long time for the move to progress and you will become impatient as you watch other stocks race by. On each pullback you are wondering if this is going to turn into a bigger drop. If you are long call options, these dips take weeks to play out and you are exposed to time decay. All of this is going to impact your confidence. The context below tells you that the stock is in a choppy up trend. It features two steps forward and one step backwards. It’s easy to reconstruct charts like the one below. “Yes, this is an upward sloping trading channel!” That’s not what you are thinking when you are in the trade. Those channels will not become apparent for a long time. When you are long a stock like this, your mind will cast doubt. These are big dips. On the left side of the chart, you can see a couple of bullish flags that you could have bought (dotted lines), but the channel did not reveal itself for quite a while so it was not something you could lean on. In the middle of the chart, you can see a downward sloping trading channel. The move lower was steady, but it featured mixed overlapping candles with lots of retracement. This was not a very strong move lower and we know that from our price action lessons. The trading channel was fairly tight, but the move lower was very choppy. This would try your patience and most traders won’t be able to stick with the move. Every time you get a nice move in your direction, the stock retraces. This “toys” with you mentally and it’s like Charlie Brown having the football yanked away just before he’s ready to kick it. </p>
<p>Stocks can and do change the manner in which they trade. Material news that impacts future earnings will change the character of the stock. In the example below, you would buy the breakout above the downward sloping trading channel (green lines). It is above all of the major moving averages and AVWAPE. The breakout starts to stall. The previous context for the stock tells you it is choppy. You take gains and you evaluate the dip. Based on the price history, you are expecting a fairly deep drop. This time it is brief and shallow, and it bounces immediately off of AVWAPE. You buy that breakout and you watch it blow through horizontal resistance (blue dotted line). You are willing to hold the initial buy, but you are not ready to add to the position because you don’t trust it. It tests horizontal support one more time and it confirms support. Buyers are supporting the breakout. This dip is also brief and shallow. Now you have the confidence to add to the position.</p>

<p>There is a huge difference between this chart and the stocks I highlighted in the other article where the price action was very steady and tight and where your confidence was high. In those instances, you know the dips will be brief and shallow because there aren’t many. You also know that when the stock eventually hits resistance that you are going to have an opportunity to exit when it makes a double top lower high. You don’t have that here. Any dip can gain traction. The above chart is “workable” if you are patient, but it would be the bare minimum I would consider trading. Between the two extremes there are much better stocks to trade. From a mental standpoint, you were never able to get behind the moves in the first part of the chart. As soon as the move was exhausted, we had to be ready to take gains because a reversal was coming. The trade duration was brief and we never had a chance to add. You are in more of a scalping mode for your swing trades. If you bought breakouts to a new relative high, the move was almost over and you had to be very careful because the dips were substantial. If you “whiffed” and missed the exit, you were going to be hanging on to a loser for a while before it turned around. You had to buy High- breakouts once support was established. These types of stocks are much more difficult to trade. Your confidence will be much lower and your odds of making money will be greatly reduced. </p>
<p>In almost every market environment, you can find stocks with strong trends and tight orderly price action. There are always companies with new products or changing business conditions that will lead to big future profits. Seek them out and be relentless. The same is true for bearish trends. Companies that are struggling will have very strong selling and the trend lower will be tight and orderly. Marginal patterns like the stock above will require greater position management and they will create more mental stress. You can find better! Look hard and don’t compromise.</p>
