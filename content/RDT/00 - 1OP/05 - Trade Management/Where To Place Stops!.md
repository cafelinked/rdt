<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Traders seek a mechanical method that will keep them in good trades and minimize losses on bad trades.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>“Where should I place my stops? If I keep them tight, I get stopped out and I miss big winners. If I keep them loose, my losses are huge.” This is a big dilemma for traders and I get this question daily. There are as many stop methods as there are traders and how risk is managed varies from person-to-person. Novices seek an optimal “one size fits all” mechanical solution that they can apply universally. If that’s you, there is no reason to read further. It doesn’t work and I will explain why. In this article I am going to get right to the heart of the matter. The stop is not the issue, there is something else you need to address first. At the end of the article, I will discuss some of the methods used for stopping a trade out and some of the special situations that arise.</p>
<p>What is a protective stop and why do we use them? Throughout this article it will be easier if I reference one side so we will be buyers (long stock). Once we enter the trade, we want to limit our downside risk exposure. It is critical to have a game plan when we are trading. A stop loss is the maximum risk that we are willing to take. If the stock drops to that level we exit the trade, we admit that our analysis was wrong and we move on. </p>
<p>According to an old sports adage, “the best defense is a great offense.” The rationale is that the offense stays on the field most of the game and it scores so much that the team’s defense is irrelevant. If you think about the nature of stop orders, they are our defense. If the stock drops to a certain level, they provide us with a safety net. If you are constantly getting stopped out, you need to improve your offense. Let’s focus on ways to improve your entries and minimize the need for stops. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Market_First">Market First</h2>
<p>Everything starts with the market and stops are no exception. The market is going to have a major impact on the underlying stock. If the S&amp;P 500 is in a down trend and you are buying a stock, there is a good chance you are going to get stopped out. No matter how strong the stock is, sooner or later sellers will knock it down and you will get stopped out. If the market is not trending, you don’t have a tailwind and there is no urgency to buy a stock. Be patient and wait for your window of opportunity. Be aware of scheduled market moving events. The time to buy stocks is not before the FOMC statement. That news is going to have a major impact and if the reaction is negative, your stops are going to get triggered. Plan ahead and reduce your exposure ahead of time so that you can weather a temporary pullback. This is when you mentally prepare for how much of a pullback you believe could happen in a worst case scenario and how much of a pullback you are willing to “shoulder.” The market itself is a conditional stop for your long stock trades. “If the SPY drops below $XXX.XX that would be a major technical breach and I am going to exit my long stocks positions.” If the reaction to the news is positive, you can buy your stocks then. Stops are not a substitute for a good game plan. “Gee… I’m glad I had my stops in place or I would have lost a lot more money than I did!” Exiting trades for a loss is painful and there is not one trader who would be happy about this. If the potential losses were included in the game plan, they calculated the odds for that outcome and they were prepared to take that risk. If the trader missed the event, they would be fuming that they took losses that should have been avoided. In the first case the trader has incorporated the event into the game plan and in the second case the trader is blindsided.</p>

<p>Stock selection has been the second major focus of this course. We’ve covered all of the desirable characteristics that need to be present. The more checkboxes we’ve marked, the higher our odds of success. Nice orderly price action is critically important. We don’t want to trade choppy stocks that do not historically trend well and that have big spikes and drops. Your odds of getting stopped out on Stock B (below) are high. Stocks that have sector strength/weakness are also less vulnerable to pullbacks because the entire sector is benefiting from asset rotation. We also look for stocks that have broken through technical resistance levels on heavy volume with follow through. The stock has demonstrated strength and that is a sign it is going to move higher. Institutions are buying the stock and they fueled the breakout. We want follow through on that breakout and no nearby overhead technical resistance. We call this “blue sky” and Stock A is a good example. It has fantastic relative strength, upward momentum, orderly price action and heavy volume breakouts. If you buy stocks that have overhead resistance, there is a good chance that the stock will not be able to breakout. Resistance is a sign of heavy selling pressure at that level. The stock could be rejected from that resistance level if sellers become more aggressive and you will be stopped out of the trade. </p>

<p>There is never a reason to compromise on your stock selection. If it does not look perfect, keep looking. There are thousands of stocks to pick from. You control the selection process. If you are constantly stopping out, chances are you are not picking good stocks. </p>
<p>Let’s say that you have the right market conditions and you found a great stock with lots of checkboxes marked, there are still things that you can do to enter the trade well. A good entry will reduce the number of times you get stopped out. In the chart below, you will notice the first breakout (left hand side of the chart). This is exactly the type of breakout we want to see. It has a long green candle on heavy volume through horizontal resistance. The close above that resistance level and the close on the high of the day is bullish. </p>
<p>During that first breakout, short-term (2-3 days) swing traders can get long on and so can day traders (left side of the chart below). They will be looking for follow through buying and relative strength on an M5 basis for confirmation. As soon as the D1 momentum stalls and the stock starts to compress, they will exit and move on to another stock. Very long-term swing traders can also take a starter position on the first breakout with the understanding that the breakout is likely to get tested (confirmation). The stock could continue to power higher and that is why they want to at least take a small starter position. They will at least have some shares if the stock never looks back. More passive longer-term swing traders would prefer to wait for that retest before taking the trade. They know they will miss some moves and they understand that the stock might never dip or compress. By the way, Option Stalker Pro has alerts that you can set using many different variables across any time frame that trigger after a dip has run its course. It is fantastic for day trading and swing trading because you can evaluate the nature of the dip and it will provide a better entry point if it was brief and shallow. They take seconds to set and they don’t tie up any capital and you have no emotional attachment to the trade.</p>
<p>Novice traders have watched the first breakout below and they are “ready.” They buy the stock when it has moved considerably above the EMA 8. At this stage they have complete confirmation of follow through. They “know” this breakout is legitimate. The stock compresses and there is some profit taking. They did not expect this and when the stock drops below the horizontal breakout, they stop out. Don’t chase stocks that surged higher and that are far from the EMA 8. Wait for the stock to compress or dip. A compression that holds all of the recent gains is very bullish. It is a sign that buyers are supporting the move and that they are offsetting profit taking. The EMA 8 has a chance to catch up and eventually buyers will get more aggressive. Enter on that compression breakout. A dip that is brief (less than 8-12 bars) and shallow (most of the recent move up is preserved) is also bullish. Those dips are good entry points when support is confirmed and when the stock is back above the EMA 8. In the chart below you can see other good entry points to get long. </p>

<p>Let’s talk about entering day trades. The same principles apply to longer-term swing trades, but day trading is much more intense because the decisions happen much faster. First of all, you should rarely trade the first 45 minutes of the session. The volatility is higher and that means you are more likely to have adverse moves that will stop you out. Let the action settle down. If you are a buyer, gaps up present greater danger. We’ve already been through this in earlier sections. A market gap up could easily reverse and most of these moves higher are challenged. The bigger the gap up, the greater our risk if the move reverses. Tight stops will get triggered instantly for a loss because of the volatility. Wide stops (loose) would be much lower and the losses would be large. When the market gaps up, all stocks “rise with the tide” and it is difficult to identify relative strength. The chart below illustrates a couple of risks. First of all, the market gapped higher so it can reverse sharply. Secondly, it is more difficult to gauge relative strength because all stocks (even the fakes) have jumped. The “fakes” will look great for the first half and hour and then reverse sharply. The final risk is that the stock gapped higher followed by extremely long green candles. These candles have a tendency to reverse because of profit taking. “FOMO Joe” who rushed in to buy this stock is going to take a world of hurt. The stop will prevent disaster, but he is going to lose money because he is in a bad trade. </p>

<p>A market pullback after a gap up will tell us which stocks want to move higher. They will be the ones ticking higher or treading water when the market pulls back. On a gap up, we want the market and the stock to hold most of the gains. We do not want to see more than half of the gap filled. If more than half of the gap is filled, we have to wait for market support. The chart below is beautiful. The market gapped higher and it had a small pullback after the open. During that time, the stock held almost all of the gains and the VWAP. When the market found support, the stock made a new high for the day. You could place the stop/alert at VWAP, but why would you do that? This stock should not go anywhere close to that level and you should be out of the trade before it gets there. You are entering the trade because you expect the market to bounce and you expect the stock to lift off immediately when that happens. You should place an alert at your entry (breakout) once the stock moves higher. You are not expecting that level to be tested again and if it is, the trade is not working out and you need find out why. Is it the market or the stock? Based on your findings you will determine if you should stay in the stock. If everything is working as planned, you evaluate the stock and the market on an ongoing basis. </p>

<p>If the market has gapped down overnight, we have to wait for support. Stocks that have relative strength early in the day will tempt you. If you buy them and the market continues to drop, they will eventually decline. You need to make sure that the market is not in a bearish trend day. Under any market condition, when 1OP for SPY M5 is spiking, we know that a market dip is likely. Instead of chasing a stock that looks great, wait to see if the bearish 1OP cycle produces a market dip. If it does, the stock will show its “true colors.” If the stock pulls back hard during the market dip and it breaches VWAP, it is probably not that strong and you should look elsewhere. If the stock holds all of the gains during the market dip, you have confirmation that it is going to move higher when the market finds support. Don’t chase single or double long green candles. This applies to the SPY and to the stock. Those big candles are much more likely to retrace, and they could have resulted from a large order (stock). Wait to see if those long candles hold. We would prefer a series of 6-8 consecutive green candles that cover the same distance. </p>

<p>The nice orderly price action on heavy volume is a sign of persistent buying over time. Look back on the M5 chart of the stock for the last week. Does it typically make wild swings? Remember, we want nice orderly price action that we can predict. If a choppy stock is making a nice move, know that it typically retraces. Don’t chase a new high for the day, buy dips. Is the stock above the prior day high? That is the first minor resistance, and I won’t even consider buying a stock that can’t move through it. Has the stock been above VWAP most of the day? That is a sign of strength and we want that if we are looking for longs. We want stocks with heavy volume because that legitimizes the move. These are ways that you can improve your entry for day trading and these tips will reduce your need for stops. </p>
<p>Traders who over-leverage rely heavily on stops because they are “scared shitless.” One bad move can be disastrous, so they need to make sure that they contain the losses by placing stops. By nature, these traders don’t give the trade enough breathing room because they can’t shoulder the losses and they are always stopped out. These same traders are typically in the “take a shot, make a lot” mindset so they are in volatile stocks. </p>
<p>Planning around scheduled events is also very important. I mentioned this in the market section, but that also applies to the stock. Have you checked the earnings calendar? Do you know when the earnings are going to be announced? Do you know the competitors and when they will announce? Typically, earnings from peers will impact other stocks in the same group. If you are oblivious to this news, you will be blindsided and your stops will get hit. I never hold stocks over the earnings announcement. That is a binary event and the outcome is random. I won’t accept a 50:50 outcome when I can have a much higher win rate trading under normal conditions. If you are aware of the pending earnings news for a competitor, you can buy the stock knowing that that risk or you can wait for the reaction and buy after the news. The point is that you are aware of the risks and you are incorporating that into the game plan. </p>

<p>There are many other events for the stock. “Investor days,” analyst conferences and new product release dates are examples. Recently, crypto stocks were strong. They were moving higher because the SEC was likely to announce the approval of a crypto ETF. The charts looked great and there was money to be made. If you entered late and you were oblivious to the news, you were stopped out for a big loss once the ETF was approved. You chased the stock, so your entry was poor and this was a “sell the news” event (chart below). </p>

<p>There are also other pending announcements that could impact the stock. They include patent litigation, civil lawsuits, regulatory changes and clinical trials. These are more difficult to “root out,” but you can take a look at the stock’s historical volatility and you can compare it to the option implied volatilities (IV) for the stock. If the IVs have been rising and the stock has been dormant, news is pending. Market makers are aware of the event and they are reflecting that uncertainty in the price of the options.</p>

<p>To this point I have not even talked about how or where to place stops. If you enter the trade well, the need for stops decreases substantially. If you are constantly getting stopped out, you need to improve your entry and your awareness. The time spent on stop placement should be less than 1% of the entire process. Stops should be an afterthought. You know what you are expecting the market to do D1 and M5. You know the scenarios that could play out and which ones are most likely. Your forecast is solid and you have handicapped the outcomes. You do the same thing for the stock D1 and M5. This analysis determines your overall confidence in the trade and the position size. During the trade you are monitoring the action, and you are deciding if you want to hold, exit or add. Novice traders have read that you must use stops. They feel like there is a secret stop formula or method that is going to vastly improve their success. If you pick shitty stocks and you enter poorly, you are going to get stopped out constantly and you are going to lose money. No stop method in the world is going to turn that around for you. </p>
<p>Let’s cover some basics and then move on to some of the techniques you can use. First of all, stops have an element of danger. They lull traders into thinking that they have a “safety net.” That “warm fuzzy” allows them to enter marginal trades because if the trade sours, they will minimize their losses. The other danger is that institutions will hunt for stops. They know where traders are likely to place them and they will try to flush you out. The stop is triggered, you establish the loss and then the stock runs higher. Sound familiar? Another risk is news related. There is a “knee jerk” reaction to a headline and the bottom falls out of the stock. You are stopped out at the worst possible price and once you’ve had a chance to read the news, you surmise that it was not going to have a material impact on the stock and that you would have held the position. The stock roars back and the stop leaves you with a big loss. For this reason, you should use alerts. They can come in the form of horizontal price alerts (same as a stop limit order), a trendline alert (similar to a trailing stop) or an indicator (exit when it flips from bullish to bearish). When the alert is triggered, you calmly evaluate the price action and the news if there was any. If the move was legitimate, you can exit on your own terms. If the move was temporary, you can reset the alert. I highly suggest you use alerts to enter and exit trades (stops losses and profit taking). </p>

<p>Below is an example of stop hunting on an intraday basis. You can see how the SPY found support many times at the same horizontal support level. Traders have been taught to buy near support and then to place their stops just below that level. This produces a low risk, high reward scenario if the SPY bounces. Institutions know how you think. They are going to push the SPY below that support to trigger those stops. Once those traders have been flushed out, the SPY rallies back into the range. They will use this same tactic around major technical levels (SMAs, trendlines and horizontal support/resistance). If the stop level is obvious to you, it is obvious to them. </p>

<p>Many books teach that trading is mechanical. “If you buy the stock your stop should be 5% lower and your target profit should be 10% higher.” I tried methods like this early in my career and they didn’t work. How likely was I to hit that 5% stop? How likely was I to hit the 10% target? What models were being used to determine the odds of those outcomes? The market doesn’t move in a mechanical fashion. Isn’t it common sense that you should look for opportunities that have greater upside than downside? At best these are basic guidelines. The moment I got rid of this rigid way of thinking, my trading improved. The 5% stop does not account for breakouts, momentum, relative strength or how far the stock has traveled. The target is arbitrary as well and you often miss the majority of the move because your exit was early. If there was a mechanical system that worked consistently, it would have been automated. If it was made public, institutions would have incorporated it into their models, and they would know exactly how to trade against you. The market is dynamic. There is no secret formula so stop looking for one. Gather information, process it and make decisions based on the price action that unfolds. </p>
<p>Remember to use alerts instead of stops. To determine that price point, ask yourself, “At what price do I know that the trade is not moving as I expected?” Since we are trading the market and “riding the fastest horse,” the exit is a function of the market and the stock. There will be times when you are long, but the market makes an unexpected big drop. If the price action suggests there is more selling to come, you should consider exiting some or all of the stock position even if the stock is holding up pretty well. If the price action for the market drop is not that daunting and the stock has had relative strength, you might consider holding it even though it has poked below a technical support level that you were leaning on. When the market recovers, the stock will rebound and then you will have a market tailwind to fuel the move. If the market has been stable and the stock falls below technical support, that was unexpected. The stock has become relatively weak. Determine if it was news related and if you need to exit. </p>
<p>What are the key technical levels where you might consider placing a stop? If you are swing trading and leaning on a D1 chart, the technical level should be visible on that time frame. You do not stop out of swing trades that drop through that price point intraday. We evaluate the position in the last 5-10 minutes of trading. As I mentioned before, institutions will be hunting for stops around key technical levels. Often a stock will move below that price point and then bounce right back. That support held as you expected. An intraday stop would have flushed you out of a good trade. Let the stock move around. You should not act based on the how a bar (D1 or M5) looks before it has finished. You wait for it to close and very often it looks different than you expected. The exception to this on a swing trade would be news related where the stock has a big gap down and it is stacking consecutive red candles with little to no overlap on heavy volume intraday. That is heavy selling, and it is likely to continue the rest of the day and perhaps for a few days. Big gaps down on news also put us on high alert. It happens to the best of us and you instantly go into loss management mode. As I mentioned earlier in this article, you exit as gracefully as you can and you gauge the price action during the day. You know you need to get out and move on. This news was unexpected and it sparked heavy selling. For swing traders these D1 technical support levels include; the major SMAs, trendlines, horizontal support/resistance, AVWAPE, and the EMA (8). If you are day trading a stock, you use shorter-term support levels based on an M5 chart. VWAP, key bars, the high/low of the day, the prior day high/low, and the open of a key bar are levels you can use. The trade duration determines the time frame we use for our stops. </p>

<p>One final tip. If you are trading options, never, never, never place stop orders based on the price of the option. The tail does not wag the dog. Option pricing is a function of the underlying stock and your exit needs to be based on the price of the stock. The bid/ask spread on an option is wide and you are always trading against a Market Maker. If the stock drops quickly, they will widen that bid/ask spread and they will drop the bid of those call options and lift the ask on put options. They don’t want to trade against a big move unless they get a great price. That means you will get filled at a horrible price. If the stop for an option order resides at a specific exchange, what happens when it doesn’t trade at that particular exchange? Is the stop triggered? What happens if your option does not trade during the drop? The stock keeps falling and your stop is not triggered. Know that you should never place a stop based on the price of the option. If the stock drops below your price an alert is triggered and then you can manage the exit and “work” the bid/ask. </p>
<p>Here are some stop methods that can be used to protect your position.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stop_Limit_Order">Stop Limit Order</h2>
<p>If the underlying stock trades at that price, the stop is activated and a limit order to exit will be placed at that price. The benefit of a stop limit is that you will not get a horrible fill because it is a limit order. The issue is that the stock drops below your price and it never looks back. Your limit order is not filled and the safety net you were counting on had a big hole in it. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Stop_Market_Order">Stop Market Order</h2>
<p>If the underlying stock trades at that price, the stop is activated and a market order is placed. The good news is that you will get out of the trade, the bad news is that it could be at a horrible price because you used a market order. If the stock has news during the day, the bottom could fall out of the stock. It could be a rumor or a “knee jerk” reaction and given time to evaluate the news, you could have managed the exit much better on your own.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Trailing_Stops">Trailing Stops</h2>
<p>The stock is going your way and you want your safety net to follow the stock higher. This is different from stopping a trade out because it is not performing well. The stop is based on a dollar amount that you specify. If you are long stock, the high is $100 and you place a $.50 trailing stop, it will exit if the stock trades at $99.50 or lower. If the stock trades up to $101.50 the stop will be raised to $101. The stop order trails the stock higher. This allows you to participate in the upside and to move the safety net higher along the way. You need to consider how volatile the stock is. If it is a nice tight orderly move, you can use a smaller dollar amount. If the stock makes choppy stair-step moves, you need to consider the depth or those moves and use that as a guide. Failure to do so will prematurely stop you out of a good trade. Keep in mind that upwards trending alert lines can be set instead of using a trailing stop. There is nothing more aggravating than getting stopped out of a good trade during a normal retracement. Use alerts. When the alert is triggered, you have an opportunity to evaluate the price action.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conditional_Stops">Conditional Stops</h2>
<p>This stop is not based on the underlying asset. It based on another asset. In the case of a call option on stock XYZ, the exit could be based on the underlying stock. For example, contingent on stock XYZ trading below $100, sell the Jan $100 calls @ $2.00 (limit order). Instead of a limit order the trader can also exit using a market order and run the risk of getting a bad fill. The conditional order can also be based on the SPY (or any other stock/ETF). If the trader is leaning on a specific support level for the SPY and it is breached, the stop for the underlying stock (or option) would be triggered. If you absolutely must use stops for options trades, you should use a conditional order based on the price of the stock. I don’t like using market orders for options for the reasons stated. To calculate where the option would be trading when the stock reaches that price, use the delta of the option as a guideline and use a stop limit order. There are also many options pricing tools you can use to calculate the approximate price of the option if the stock reaches that price. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Time_Stops">Time Stops</h2>
<p>This is something you should use. This is not an order that can be placed. Based on all of your analysis you are expecting the market and the stock to behave in a specific manner within a defined period of time. With each passing moment, you need confirmation that your analysis was correct. If the market is moving higher as expected and the stock is not moving higher as expected, you might exit the trade. You give the stock as much time as you feel is appropriate, but the trade is on “borrowed time.” If the market is not moving higher as expected and the stock is not moving higher as expected, you might exit the trade. When you enter a trade you are timing the entry at what you believe is the best moment. For every M5 bar (day trades) and every day (swing trades) that passes without movement, your odds of success decline until they eventually reach 50%. You should not be in a trade with those odds so somewhere along the line you need to exit and realize that your original analysis was “off.” There is no harm in taking a small loss, a scratch or a small gain. The trade did not perform as you expected. Everything was in place for the stock to move higher and it didn’t. When you exit the trade, set alerts so that if the stock does start to move you can consider reentry. There are times when you have to enter at a higher price, but then you have confirmation that the move is underway and your odds are better. There have been many times when you will be glad that exited a position on a time stop. A surprise news event hits the stock or the market and you did not have the risk exposure associated with a stock that was not “behaving.” This strategy also frees up your capital for other opportunities and it is one less position you have to monitor. So let’s look at an example. </p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/time-stop-645x1024.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="71393d55-32d9-4321-adca-f8ce47abec0f">

                        </a>
                        <div class="h6 fst-italic mt-3 mt-md-0 ms-md-4 gallery-caption"></div>
                    </div>
                
<p>In the example, above the stock has incredible strength on the left side of the chart. It is stacking green candles and you want to ride the move as long as you can. You will be watching for any dips. They need to be brief and shallow. If each dip lasts longer and is a little deeper, that is a sign of resistance and you need to take gains. There weren’t any dips. You will also be looking for a compression. If the relative strength wanes and the stock starts to compress, you should take gains and see what happens next. The powerful move has us expecting it to go higher and you believe you will be buying a compression breakout. The stock has a brief and shallow dip and a nice bounce. That forms a bullish flag in the middle of the chart and it is time to buy. You are expecting it to blow through the compression high immediately. That is how bullish flags work. The SPY staged another move higher the next two days, but the stock did not participate. It had a bullish flag formation, incredible strength over the last two months and a market tailwind. It doesn’t get any better than this, but the stock was not able to get through horizontal resistance. Under the best conditions it did not do what we wanted – time stop. You exit the trade and you wait to see what happens. If the stock breakout through the D1 high, you will know it because you set an alert there. You need that confirmation. During the next week, the SPY dips and it makes a higher low. The stock dips and it makes a lower low. This is a sign of weakness. When the market surges through the previous high, the stock does not even challenge horizontal resistance and it is weak relative to the market. You could have placed a stop when you entered the bullish flag, but why would you wait to take a loss? Everything you needed for an immediate move higher was in place and it did not happen. Exit, set alerts and evaluate. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Indicators">Indicators</h2>
<p>Instead of using technical support/resistance levels to stop a trade out, some traders will exit long positions when an indicator flips from bullish to bearish. LRSI and SMI are two indicators that can be used. As long as they are bullish, you stay in the trade. When they turn bearish it is time to exit. I have not used this method because I feel that most indicators lag. Knowing how to read price action is more reliable and it is current.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Price_Action">Price Action</h2>
<p>We’ve discussed the price action we are looking for to enter the trade properly. Be selective and your need for stops will decrease dramatically. We’ve also discussed the price action that would trigger our exit on a big drop through technical support. Price action can also be used to exit winning trades and I will cover that in another article. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day_Trading_Stops">Day Trading Stops</h2>
<p>Intraday price movement can include the prior day high/low or the current day high/low. It can also use the open of a Key Bar. If you are long stock and you get a green Key Bar (or any oversized green bar) you want that open to hold. Buyers were there before and when that level is tested, you want to see that they are still there. The open for that bar would be where you place a stop. VWAP can also be used as a stop. Know that VWAP is like a magnet for the stock and that it is likely to be tested. Institutions are aware of all the price points that have been mentioned so they will often hunt for stops around them. This is another good reason to use alerts instead of stops. Instead of being head faked out of a position, you will get the alert and then you can determine if the move is legitimate or fabricated by programs.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>When should you stop a trade out?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When you know you were wrong.</p>
<p>The key to every trade is to have a game plan. The trade duration is defined and in that set period of time you are expecting the market to do “X” and you are expecting the stock to do “X.” Your analysis is based on the previous price action for both and you can assign a level of confidence. You are aware of scheduled events and you are picking the best stocks that have room to run with little to no overhead resistance. The game plan includes characteristics that will confirm that you are in a good trade, and it will include characteristics that tell you it is a bad trade. With regards to a bad swing trade, you might be expecting a technical support level like the 100-day SMA to hold. That level is not selected because it is X% below your entry price. It is selected because a normal sized retracement for the stock would put that support level within striking distance. You are not expecting it to be tested, but if it is, you are expecting it to hold. There could be a scheduled economic release that could cause the market to drop and if that happens, you are mentally prepared for how far it might drop and you are willing to take that risk. If the market surges higher for 3 days, the stock needs to move higher as well. If it is compressing or drifting lower, that is not what you expected. It is time to stop the trade out even if it is a scratch or a marginal winner. The stock is not doing what you expected. Go to the sidelines, set alerts in case the stock starts to perform and look for other opportunities. </p>
<p>Longer-term trades should have more room to move (wide stops), and they should be granted more time to perform. You should place wider stops on volatile stocks and tighter stops on orderly stocks. The stops for swing trades are evaluated at the end of the day. Short-term trades need to perform immediately and the stops need to be tighter. The evaluation is constant. </p>
<p>Here are two parting thoughts. If you are getting stopped out frequently, focus on improving your entry. If you are nailing your entries the stock will perform and you will be managing profits instead of worrying about risk. Secondly, don’t use stops, use alerts. Alerts will give you an opportunity to evaluate the situation and then you can decide if the move is legitimate or fake. If it is legitimate, you can use your trading skills to improve the exit vs bailing on the trade because it hit a specific price. </p>
