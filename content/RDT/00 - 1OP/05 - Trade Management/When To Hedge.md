<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Hedging is another word for protection. Think of it as buying insurance. This can be a complicated process, so let me simplify it for you. </h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Institutions need to hedge because they have very large long-term positions that would be difficult and costly to “unwind.” There could be temporary uncertainty that they need to navigate so they buy that protection. This course was not written for large institutional traders. On occasion, retail investors might have long-term stock positions that require a hedge. They want to hold the original position to postpone capital gains taxes and that would be a legitimate reason to sell calls against the stock (covered call writing) or to buy protective puts (married put position) or to sell calls and buy puts (a collar). If this describes your situation, you can search for those topics and explore the strategy that best suits you. This course is written for traders and not investors, so we are not going to explore those hedges. Instead, we are going to explore why traders that have a relatively short-term trade duration (less than six months) might hedge.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the most basic scenario, the stock trader. Let’s suppose that the market is in a nice up trend and they have a basket of stock positions. They have nice gains and they want to lock them in. They only trade stock and they don’t “mess with options.” Their only recourse it to sell some of the stock positions, so they scale out. In doing so they reduce risk and they lock in profits. This approach is simple, effective and elegant. Trading is complicated and when I have the opportunity to simplify it, I do. That is why I use this method. I don’t hedge. If I sense uncertainty in the stock, I reduce my position. If I sense uncertainty in the market, I reduce my positions. </p>
<p>The need to hedge stems from uncertainty. Sometimes it is real and sometimes it is perceived. So let’s explore each of those. Our first concern is always the market. It drives all of our decision making. If the price action is extremely choppy with little to no direction, we should be focusing on very short-term trades and we should be keeping our trade size small and our trade count low. We don’t have a clear sense of market direction so our odds are low. Since we are focusing on short-term trades and since we are keeping our positions small, we don’t really have a need to hedge. We are in and out of positions and we will continue to use this approach until conditions change. On the other extreme, if the market is in a nice orderly trend higher with tight price action, we are aggressively long. We have large positions and a lot of risk exposure. As long as the orderly price action is preserved, we don’t need the hedge. If we start to see more dips, we take notice that the upward momentum is starting to decelerate and we start reducing our position size. If the dips are deeper and they last longer, we reduce our position size even further. We recognize that market conditions are changing, so we adjust our risk based on our observations of price action. </p>
<p>We trade stocks with relative strength and relative weakness. That is our edge. We never compromise when it comes to trading stock. You should never, never, never be trading a choppy directionless stock. There are thousands of stocks to pick from and you can always find one that is trending higher or lower in a nice tight orderly fashion. If you can’t find one, keep looking. They’re out there. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Choppy_Directionless_Markets">Choppy &amp; Directionless Markets</h2>
<p>If market conditions are choppy and directionless, you are more likely to find both longs and shorts with relative strength and relative weakness respectively. You will take confidence in the nice tight stock trends and you will have a basket of longs and shorts. Your market risk is minimal because you have positions on both sides. Since the market is directionless, you keep your size relatively small. There are plenty of stocks in bullish and bearish searches and the candidates are fairly balanced. Sooner or later, the market is going to breakout in one direction or the other. When that happens, you are going to Identify that and you will be able to favor one side more than the other. If the market is starting to trend higher, you will have more long positions than short positions. Your searches will have more bullish prospects to choose from and your “mix” of longs and shorts will adjust naturally. As the market up trend is established and confirmed, it will become much more difficult to find good bearish patterns and the bullish patterns will be abundant. During the entire process, you are never compromising on the chart patterns. The D1 must have a nice, tight, orderly trend or we don’t trade the stock. I’ve taught you the price patterns to look for that would indicate that the stock is losing its trend. When you see those signs, you start taking gains and eventually you are out of the position. You find new stocks to replace them. This is a very simple model and it adjusts naturally. The market dictates if we are bullish or bearish or neutral. It also dictates our position size and our trade duration. If the market is directionless and choppy, our trades are shorter in duration and our position size is smaller. When the market is trending, our position size is larger and we are adding to our positions when we have confirmation. Our trades are also much longer in duration because we want to ride the trend.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned that retail investors might need to postpone capital tax gains and that is a legitimate reason to hedge. Day traders and short-term swing traders with a week or less holding period have no need to hedge – ever. They are trading the current price action and when the move is exhausted, they take gains. They have their finger on the pulse and they throttle risk based on the short-term price action through their position size and trade count. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Earnings_Scheduled_Events">Earnings &amp; Scheduled Events</h2>
<p>Longer-term swing traders who have a trade duration of 6 months or less could run into unexpected stock moves. I do not advocate holding over earnings announcements so there is no need to hedge. Get out of the stock before the announcement and trade it after the reaction. Predicting earnings reactions is a 50:50 proposition and this is a scheduled binary event. Our odds are much higher trading under normal conditions so we avoid holding over earnings releases. There will be moments when a stock makes an unexpected overnight move on surprise news. There is nothing we can do about that. Sometimes the news will hurt us, but it typically helps us. You will find that the news is “leaking” into the marketplace ahead of time and we are picking it up in the price action. We are on the “right” side of the news and this happens constantly. Evaluate the news and its impact on future earnings. Based on your findings, exit the position entirely, exit some of it or decide to hold all of it. The news will quickly be disseminated and it will find its new resting point. If you are in a stock and it is relatively flat, monitor the options implied volatilities (IVs) for the near term at the money strike price. If you notice that the option IVs are starting to rise, that is a sign that there is uncertainty ahead. This is a warning sign. It could be a clinical trial or litigation that will soon be released. These events tend to fly under the radar, but the Market Makers are aware of it so they reflect that in the price of the options. This scenario is avoidable and it is another example of a binary event that we want to avoid. By the way, you should never be camped out in a stock that is flat for more than a couple of weeks. We want stocks that are moving. The example below is Nvidia. The stock was flat and earnings would not be released for another two months. The option IVs were rising because it was hosting a huge AI conference and the chances of a “surprise announcement” were high. </p>

<p>New product launches and investor conferences are scheduled events. If you decide to hold through these periods, you are aware of them and you are willing to shoulder the risk. Instead of taking a larger position and then hedging it, simply take a smaller position. Again, I prefer to not have a position into these events. If the stock rallies ahead of it, we often see a negative reaction (“sell the news”). These situations don’t require a hedge, you are either in the trade and willing to accept the risk… or not. Some news comes out of “left field” and it is something that no one could have predicted. Some stocks tend to be “newsier” than others and that is often reflected in the price action. A company might lower guidance or perhaps it has a factory recall on one of its products. It happens randomly and infrequently. Adjust your position and move on. The other events (earnings, product releases, litigation) can be avoided by checking the corporate schedule and by watching the option IVs relative to the stock’s movement. If you are willing to accept the risk, hold the position. If not, get out. </p>
<p>Longer-term swing traders want to hedge in case there is a “large” “surprise'” “market drop.” This is an odd statement with some key words. Many traders are worried about “large” drops of more than 10%. They can weather the small drops and adjust risk, but the big moves are very destructive. “Surprise” moves keep them up at night worrying that they might have missed something. As you will see, there are always warning signs and there are no “surprise” moves. Longer-term swing traders are worried about a “market drop.” We already covered the stock component, but why do we only need a hedge against a market drop and not a market bounce? There are a few reasons. No one complains when the market screams higher, only when it tanks. That’s because most traders favor the long side. If the market is falling and they are short, they are not thinking about hedging those shorts. We don’t often see bear markets that last more than a year or two. When you are short, you are always walking on “thin ice.” If you look at the 50-year chart of the S&amp;P 500, you will see that it has an incredibly strong up trend. The bear markets are a tiny pimple on a long-term chart. This explains why long-term investors can “dollar cost average” without fear. They know that bear markets provide them with a better entry point and the market “always comes back.” When you are trading from the short side, you are always nervous. The drops are huge, but you are trading against a 50+ year uptrend. When you get a big market drop, your shorts will perform incredibly well and you will have massive profits. Take your gains when you see those stomach wrenching moves lower that leave you feeling that the market will never rally again. The market will bounce and those moves will be equally violent. Traders who short during bear markets know that the Fed will do everything in its power to prevent a crash. They will have emergency rate cuts and they will “drop money from helicopters” (i.e. $3 trillion in Covid-19 relief) if needed. I have even seen the Fed announce a rate cut the morning of options expiration during the 2008-2009 financial crisis to inflict as much pain on shorts as possible. The market rocketed higher on the news. Your strategy in a bear market is to short bounces and take profits on massive drops. You are always nervous and you are always expecting bounces. Evaluate the height and duration of the bounce. If the bounce stalls at a resistance level that is lower than the high from the previous bounce (lower high), it might be time to reload your short positions. There is no need to hedge, you are in “hit and run” mode. We haven’t talked about options as a hedge, but during big market drops, those hedges would be extremely expensive because option implied volatilities are spiking. This is why no one ever asks about hedging in a bear market. So let’s talk about the need for hedging the other 80% of the time when the market is flat to higher. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Horizontal_Trading_Ranges">Horizontal Trading Ranges</h2>
<p>There are periods where the market is trapped in a horizontal trading range for 60-days or more. The price action will be choppy, and buyers &amp; sellers are generally in agreement (equilibrium). If the width of the range is greater than 10%, you might be able to favor the short side when the market is near the upper end of the range and the long side when it is near the lower end of the range. The market tends to keep on doing what it has been doing and if there is no material news that changes the economic backdrop, it will stay in the range. The market has no direction and that means we keep our trade size smaller. There will be strong stocks and there will be weak stocks so our portfolio will have a mix of longs and shorts. Regardless of the market backdrop, there will always be companies that do very well and those that do poorly. For instance, in a period of economic weakness, car manufacturers could be in a steady decline because people can’t afford a new car, but auto supply stores could be in a strong up trend because people need parts for their older cars. The point is that there are always stocks with nice orderly tight trends in any market environment and we never compromise. Our positions are small and balanced (longs and shorts) and there is no need for a market hedge. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Upward_Trending_Markets_Trading_Channels">Upward Trending Markets &amp; Trading Channels</h2>
<p>The final condition we face is an upward trending market. We know these are common just by looking at a long-term chart. Some trends will be sloppy and there will be many dips and retracements. We recognize that the market is moving higher in a stair-step fashion. Longer-term swing traders understand that they will have to “weather” some bumps in the road and they are mentally prepared for that. Short-term traders will time those cycles. When the market dips, they will be watching for signs of support and they will buy. The market will stage the next leg of the rally and when it hits resistance, short-term traders will take gains. When this is the prevailing pattern, find an upward sloping trendline with at least 3 touches. It could connect the highs or the lows. If you draw through the body of an outlying candle or two, don’t worry about it. Then try to “fit” the other trendline so that it is roughly parallel to it. This will simply act as a visual aid. The choppy trend higher prevents us from getting overly aggressive with our trades. Every time the market stages a horizontal breakout to a new relative high, it quickly stalls out. Our guard is up so there is never any need to hedge. We buy dips and we take gains into strength. </p>
<p>The chart below shows you how to draw a trading channel. In the early stages, you don’t even know if a channel is forming. You just see big drops and big bounces. We don’t have a lot of data, but the dotted lines provide us with an early indication of what we might expect. As the down trend matures, you would be able to draw the heavier lines. Again, these do not need to be perfect, they are a visual aid. The chart below is a downward sloping trading channel, but the price action will be very similar in an upward sloping channel. A sloppy trend higher or lower would not warrant hedging. We are in and out of positions based on the stair-step pattern and the trading channel. This is a common pattern and it can last for many months. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Nice_Tight_Orderly_Trends_Higher">Nice, Tight, Orderly Trends Higher</h2>
<p>The final market pattern we haven’t discussed is our favorite one. It is a nice, tight, orderly trend higher. Buyers are so aggressive that there is very little retracement. Every little dip is gobbled up before it can get going. We recognize this strength and we are aggressively buying stocks. There is no need to suspect that these buyers are going to be deterred. They love the macro backdrop and they are putting long-term money to work. We are going to be doing the same. With each tiny dip that is instantly reversed, our confidence grows and we are adding to bullish positions. Now we have lots of downside risk exposure and this is the only time when we would even have to consider a hedge. </p>
<p>There are a few reasons why you might be considering a hedge. One is that you have big gains and you are “afraid” that you will give them all back. “Black Swan” events are very rare and we will get to those a little later in the article. This is not a legitimate reason to hedge. If you can’t sleep at night because you are worried, your position is too large. Don’t hedge, take some of the position off and reduce your risk. All arrows are pointing higher, but you don’t have the confidence in your analysis to hold on even though that might be the right thing to do. In fact, you might be in a situation where you should be adding based on the price action, but you are running scared. It’s OK. With experience, you will be able to replace fear with confidence and you will trust your analysis. Another reason traders hedge is because they see signs of strain. For some traders, all it will take is one red candle and they will freak out. We need those red candles, we just don’t want too many of them consecutively. When the red candles reverse immediately, they actually confirm trend strength. The bigger issue for this trader is that the position is too large. Take some of the position off and scale out so that you can regain your clarity. The final reason traders want to hedge is because they see the trend strength starting to wane. The candle bodies are tiny and the price action is compressing near a relative high. If the compression is happening when the market is still heading higher on light volume, a dip is coming. Don’t hedge. The decision is to weather a small dip and to hold the long positions or to reduce risk by selling some of your positions. Both decisions are fine. What often happens is that the trader who decides that they are going to stay the course loses their nerve when the dip comes. They are more likely to exit near the low of the dip which is actually where they should be buying. You know your personality so be true to yourself. “Are you really going to be able to stomach a dip?” “How much of a dip can you handle?” Quantify it. If you are a “nervous Nellie,” take gains and reduce risk when the trend is starting to lose its momentum. A seasoned trader who is willing to ride out a dip knows that they have been buying on the way up and that their average cost is well below current levels. Instead of trading in and out of positions, they will hold the line and they will be ready to add on the dip. This pattern (a light volume float higher with tiny bodied candles) is a little more indicative that a dip is coming because the market has “fluffy gains” that can easily be taken back. Those moves result from a “sellers boycott” (very little supply) and bullish speculators are vulnerable. The light volume tells us the conviction is low and the tiny bodied candles tell us that sellers are nearby. The recent gains will eventually spark profit taking. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Horizontal_Compressions">Horizontal Compressions</h2>
<p>Sometimes we see horizontal compressions after a big move higher. This is different from the compression on a gradual move higher I just described. The candle bodies are also tiny and the momentum slows. In the chart below, you can see that we were coming out of a decline and the market was the early stages of a recovery (bearish trend reversal). There is plenty of upside so hold the line. These horizontal compressions are actually very bullish and the next leg higher will come soon. The compression won’t last long. Profit takers are keeping a lid on the action and the market is simply digesting recent gains. The fact that there is no retracement tells us that all of those gains are being preserved. Buyers are aggressive and they are offsetting any supply. You should not be looking to hedge and you should not be exiting longs. On an upside breakout, you should be ready to add. </p>

<p>When the horizontal compressions last more than a month and when the trend has been established for more than a year, the momentum could start to wane. In the chart below, we can see that the market had been somewhat choppy with a stair-step pattern higher. Dips were common. As the market enters the shaded area of the chart, we start watching for a dip. In this case, the dip did not bounce right away, it retested support. That is fine, but it is a sign that there was a little more selling pressure that needed to be worked off. When the market bounced, it could not get through horizontal resistance. A marginal new high signaled that sellers were present. In this case, it looked like a longer-term horizontal trading range might result. This would still not be a time to hedge, it would be a time to lighten up on bullish stock positions. Eventually, the market does recover. Given the context of the move, you would proceed with caution and you would not aggressively add. On the right side of the chart, we can see that the price action has improved substantially. The second dip was brief and shallow relative to the previous dip and it made a higher low. It looks like this rally is improving and the price action gives us the confidence to be more aggressive with longs. In all this time, we have still not talked about hedging, but we will for the rest of the article. </p>

<p>At this stage, we have a market that had shown some signs of resistance, but it recovered and it was gathering strength. The dips were getting smaller and they weren’t lasting as long. The price action was nice and tight, so we started to increase our position size. In the chart below you can see a tiny compression (first blue shaded area in the chart below), but that might not have been enough to prompt some traders to take gains. We are aware that September is seasonally weak so it’s wise to use extra caution. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgJJ4rW4dS0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a video from 9/13/21</a>. That video was right at the top of the compression and you can see what I was thinking at the time and how we traded. Let’s say that you are willing to ride out what could be a soft patch. The market started to pullback. Nothing severe, just a normal dip in a bullish trend. It poked through the 50-day MA and it had not done that in many months. This was still not anything to get too worried about. The next day, the market gapped down and it touched the 100-day MA. This was a much bigger dip than we expected and we had seen a drop of this magnitude in the last year. The move was fairly sudden and it was a warning sign. The bounce barely got back to the 50-day MA and it found resistance. This was not the typical bounce we had seen previously. In the past, buyers were aggressive and the market shot right up to a new relative high after a period of weakness. If you had a lot of stock positions, you could have shorted the S&amp;P 500 futures for a hedge at this moment. You would calculate your overall dollar allocation to stocks and divide that number by the dollar equivalent of one futures contract to calculate how many futures contracts you needed to short. The logic behind this is that the move is not going to last a long time. Instead of unwinding all of your stock positions, you can just short the futures in case the next leg lower is deeper. Your stocks have relative strength and they will hold up well relative to the S&amp;P 500 so you don’t want to sell your stocks. Something has changed the macro market backdrop and you are trying to determine what it is. There is uncertainty and your confidence has been shaken (that is why you are hedging). While you investigate, your position is protected. This happened in September and that is one of the weakest months of the year so this could simply be “seasonal weakness.” You don’t have to “perfectly hedge” the position. You can do fewer futures contracts if you are fairly confident the market will bounce. You can also reduce risk by selling some of the stocks you own that have become relatively weak. The point is that this drop is not like the others. It is deeper than the others and you need a little protection. The market tested the 100-day MA a second time and it bounces through the downward sloping High- (H-) trendline. You buy back your S&amp;P 500 hedge and the market recovers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlE6H1mMtDg&amp;t=533s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a video from 10/13/21</a> and you can see what I was thinking just before the bounce. You are still confident in the strength of the long-term trend and you are also confident that the market will try to get back to the previous high. Buyers have been buying dips for over a year, and they are likely to buy this one as well. When the market compresses at a new high, you take gains. That last drop was deeper than we had seen and it lasted longer than the others. This is a warning sign. We are in December and this is typically a strong month into year end. If we decided to hold some of the position, we are not expecting a dip at this time of year, but we got one. On the next bounce and compression, it’s time to exit longs. The price action is getting very choppy. That is a sign that the selling pressure is building and that the trend is starting to weaken. We don’t need to hedge, it is time to go to the sidelines. We rarely see selling in December and this is a warning sign. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p6hp81cSrQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a video I recorded during the second dip on 12/20/21</a> and you can see what I was thinking. The market back drop had changed. Inflation was hitting levels that we had not seen in 40 years and the Fed was preparing to raise interest rates. Anyone can go back in time and analyze a chart. They know the outcome so they structure their comments to fit the outcome. That’s why we have so many “gurus.” I don’t do that. These were my comments at the time and the price action was driving my decisions. It tells us when to be long, when to be balanced, when to be short, when to trade aggressively and when to trade passively. We throttle our risk to match the price action and there are not many times when we need to hedge. This is not simply “lip service,” this is how we actually traded.</p>

<p>We’ve covered every market condition. If you are watching price action, you don’t need to hedge. When the market is in a down trend the price action is much more volatile. You are in hit and run move because huge drops don’t last long and there are violent snap back rallies. Don’t hedge your shorts, take gains! When the market is range bound, we don’t need to hedge. Our positions are smaller and we have a balance of longs (stocks with relative strength) and shorts (stocks with relative weakness). Our market risk is very low for that reason. When the market is in a normal stair-step rally, we expect dips along the way. We can choose to throttle our swing trades (buy dips and take gains into rips) or we can decide to hold the positions and ride out the dips. If the dips are deeper and if they start to last longer, we know the trend is weakening so we reduce our size. Our greatest risk comes when the market is in a very tight, orderly trend with heavy volume. There aren’t any dips because buyers are aggressive. For that reason, we know the bid is strong and we are aggressive as well. This is when you will be tempted to add a hedge. There is nothing in the price action to suggest that you need one. If you can’t trust what the price action is telling you, reduce your exposure, but don’t hedge. When that powerful move higher ends, we will see the warning signs in the price action. A gradual float higher on light volume with tiny compressed candle bodies will be a sign that a dip is coming. Take some risk off, wait for the dip and once support is confirmed, re-establish your longs. When we have very strong trends, we will typically see at least three dips with bullish flags before the momentum wanes completely.</p>

<p>What about “Black Swan” events? Apart from the “Flash Crash” in 2010 that lasted 35 minutes, I have not seen a crash that was not preceded by price action warning signs. The “2001 Tech Bubble,” the “2008 Financial Crisis” and even the “Covid-19 Crash” had warning signs. We had not seen global contagion in our lifetimes and this was the biggest and fastest market drop ever. The world stopped. The problems in China were well-publicized if you were paying attention. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENlHKJiJbuU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is a video from Friday (2/21/20)</a> the day before the “Covid-19 Crash.” I also did a follow up video that Sunday night and you can find it on my YouTube channel. The warning signs were there and you can see how we had a few remaining options positions that were hedged with VXX calls. “VXX calls, what’s that?” To this point, I have not even talked about options so we might as well dig in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Options_VXX_Calls">Options &amp; VXX Calls</h2>
<p>If you listen to most “gurus,” options are the answer to everything. Who knows, they might even cure cancer. They will tell you that with options “you can make money if the market goes up, stays flat or goes down.” That is true if you know the direction, magnitude and duration of the move and if you get those components right. They don’t teach you how to do that, but I do. They will teach you that if you are worried about your portfolio, you should buy some SPY/SPX put options or to buy some VIX/VXX calls. They will explain all sorts of risk/reward scenarios and then they will calculate the number of puts you need to buy and how long you need the protection. They might tell you how to create spreads to make the insurance cheaper. You might even create a position where you can more than offset portfolio losses if the market really tanks. “Worried about your stock? Buy some put options on the stock. Really worried about your stock? Let’s sell some calls and use the proceeds to buy some puts (collar).” This is all a big steamy pile of @#$%. We are traders and we don’t have to worry about capital gains taxes on long-term holdings. That is the only time when you need a hedge. This hedging exercise is gigantic waste of time and it complicates your trading. It makes these “gurus” sound authoritative and they spew this garbage to sell you their product. If you have reason to believe that conditions are changing and that you need a hedge, exit some of your holdings and reduce risk. Keep it simple. </p>
<p>So, in the video I mentioned that I was long VXX calls as a hedge. We had a few out of the money bullish put spreads that had a week until expiration on 2/28/20. They were way out of the money and I did not want to buy them back in. Option bid/ask spreads are often fairly wide and with a spread you have two legs to each trade, so they are a little harder to enter and exit (there is more slippage). They were very likely to expire and we would realize our maximum profit. Instead of buying them back, we bought calls on VXX. If the market tanked, option implied volatilities would explode and VXX would increase in value. VXX measures the option implied volatilities for farther out in time SPX options. There is a similar product called VIX that measures nearer term option implied volatilities. When there is uncertainty in the market, option premiums expand. That typically happens when there is a big market drop. At the time, option premiums were very cheap and if the market did drop, I viewed buying VXX calls as a nice trade with a great risk/reward profile and it would offset any possible loss on our spreads. I don’t hedge so I’m not going to explain these instruments in any greater detail. They are an institutional product and you can visit the CBOE website to learn more. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When_I_Hedge">When I Hedge</h2>
<p>There are a couple of instances when I will hedge. If I have a large number of options positions that have a directional bias (long stock, long calls and/or short bullish put spreads) and I get blindsided, I will short S&amp;P 500 futures on an intraday basis. It does not happen often, but I need some temporary protection and this provides it to me instantly. Unwinding a basket of positions is difficult and it takes time. When I get caught by a big contra market move, the option bid/ask spreads widen out and exiting can be very difficult and costly because of the slippage. It is much easier for me to just short S&amp;P 500 futures and then to evaluate the news and the price action during the drop. If the news is damaging and it will have a longer-term impact on the market, I will hold the futures hedge overnight and I will start exiting my positions when the market settles down and the bid/ask spreads start to narrow. If the move was an over-reaction, I wait for the dust to settle and I remove the hedge the same day. An example of when I had to do this was when Donald Trump was President. The market would be clipping along and then the bottom would fall out. “We’re going to increase tariffs on China to 100%! My red button is bigger than yours… and mine works!” We quickly learned that we needed to have a live Twitter feed and to watch for his press conferences. The other time I might hedge is if there is an adverse move related to a news release (i.e. FOMC or an economic number). I was aware of the news, but I did not expect a big reaction and it warranted a hedge. Again, these instances are rare and they might only happen a couple of times a year. I just need some temporary protection. If I feel that a major scheduled news event could result in a big market move, I reduce risk into the release. I am looking ahead and planning around these events. I wait for the reaction and then I resume trading. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Hedging_Is_Expensive_Complex">Hedging Is Expensive &amp; Complex</h2>
<p>I don’t like hedging because the hedges are expensive. Hedges vary in cost depending on market conditions, option implied volatiles, and the desired amount of protection. When I was in the brokerage side of the business, I would run the calculations for large customers and explain that a hedge would cost 5-7% for six months of protection. They would ask for clarity, “If my portfolio goes up 5-7% in six months it would just cover the expense of the hedge?” Yes, and then you would make money above that. They never did the hedge. If you are nervous, take some risk off. </p>
<p>Another problem with hedges is that they don’t always work as expected. In the example above, if you used an index to hedge and you bought at the money SPX/SPY puts with 6 months of life and the index went up 7%, the hedge is not dynamic. It is not a safety net that moves higher with the index. It is still 7% lower. Those puts are exposed to time decay. When they expire, there is no hedge and you are unprotected. If you bought index puts to protect your portfolio, your stocks might drop by a greater percentage than the index. If you are hedging using VXX/VIX, the market might drop, but option implied volatilities might not spike. This is often the case during a slow drift lower. Your hedge is not working. Institutions are always eager to sell volatility and the move lower needs to be fast and sustained for option implied volatilities to spike. During a brief market drop, you might sustain losses on your portfolio and not realize any gains in the VXX/VIX position. VIX/VXX rises when there is sustained downward movement. As soon as the market finds support, the option implied volatilities contract. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my experience hedging is a waste of time, energy and money. They often don’t work properly and they complicate your trading instead of simplifying it. You will constantly be adjusting the hedge and monitoring it to make sure it is working properly. There will be times when you take profits on your hedge too early and the market drop has not run its course. Now you are exposed. We are not giant institutions that need to hedge massive portfolios. We are traders who can read price action and we adjust our risk quickly. This is one of the few advantages we have so we had better take advantage of it. When you reduce risk, you have cash and you have flexibility. Instead of worrying about your hedge, you will be focused on new opportunities. You will not have a basket of “mush” to manage, you will have a clean slate to work with. </p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions: Why do you think you need a hedge? What is it about the price action that has you concerned? If you are seeing warning signs, reduce your risk. If you are nervous for no reason, your position is too large. Reduce your risk exposure. Scared money never wins and you have no staying power. Know that you don’t have to sell all of the position at once, scale out.</p>
<p>Much of this article had to do with reading price action and adjusting risk. I tried to describe the market conditions and stock conditions you will encounter and how you should be trading them. The bottom line is to keep it simple. Don’t complicate your trading by hedging. If you feel the need, reduce your risk. Cash is king and cash is a position.</p>
