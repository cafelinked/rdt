<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Position sizing is a dynamic process based on current information. This analysis determines if we should add to the position, take profits, or stop out.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<p>Yesterday I posted an article on position sizing.&nbsp;<a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/how-to-size-your-positions/">Please read that article first.&nbsp;</a>The lesson was that position sizing comes at the very end of the decision-making process. It is the final brush stroke, and this is the culmination of all of your trading skills right up to the point where you click the trade button. Your position sizing and strategic approach are dynamic and they adjust to changing market conditions. In this article, I will provide you with an example from a video I recorded Friday on the open and from my comments in the chat room Friday. I will breakdown all of the components to illustrate my point.</p>
<p>First of all, most novices never make it to the point where position sizing matters. I’m just being honest. They won’t paper trade and they won’t trade one share until they get their win rate up. They will just dive in, lose their money and blame someone/something else for their mistakes. Those who are trading with 1 share might not put the hours in “at the gym” or spend time “watching film” or “studying the playbook” like Tom Brady does. These are the thankless hours of preparation where you put everything you have into learning and training. Only faith and determination keep you engaged because there are no visible signs that all of this effort is going to pay off. Consequently, many aspiring traders quit before they ever reach the 75% win rate. This is a weeding out process and it is common to any high paying profession.</p>
<p>This article is for those of you who reach that 75% win rate for a few consecutive months. As much as I’d like to tell you that your learning has ended, it has not and it never will. The good news is that there is “light” and you are seeing progress. This is also the stage where you can actually start making a little money. It is like the years you put into a college degree and now you are going to get paid for that knowledge. This is where the mental aspect of trading comes into play and this is also where you define your trading personality. What I am about to describe is unique to me. It is how I processed all of the information and how it culminated with trades that suited my style. I gave the play-by-play in a video and in the chat room Friday, so these are NOT backwards engineered, “cherry picked” trades that I pulled out of thin air. This was my thought process from the beginning.</p>

<p>Credit concerns have surfaced with the SIVB failure. Credit Suisse and others are on the ropes. Asset Managers who might have been buying near the major MAs are going to hold off for a few months. The bid will soften until they are confident that banks are stable and that credit is not going to be an issue. Stock valuations are relatively high (forward P/E of 18) so there is no rush for them to buy aggressively. FOMC next week, swings are risky and the market could go either way. Stick to day trading and be in cash before the FOMC statement Wednesday.</p>

<p>The intraday ranges are expanding and the major MAs have failed. The market has been making lower highs and lower lows the last few weeks and the down days have come on heavy volume. Two major D1 trendlines have been breached in the last two weeks on long red candles and heavy volume. This is neutral to bearish.</p>

<p>The market staged a big rally Thursday. Stacked green candles on heavy volume and a close through the major MAs. Could have been short covering and triple witch related. Are buyers still there? The market gapped down below the 100-day MA. The 200-day is going to provide some support at $392.77. Mixed overlapping candles on lower volume to start the day – lack of direction early. Buyers are trying to push SPY into the gap. That attempt failed instantly and two red candles erased the move. 1OP bearish cross, look for shorts.</p>

<p>I want to find a stock that has relative weakness and long red candles through a major technical support level on heavy volume. Ideally, the stock has been down during the recent market bounce and it finished lower during the market bounce yesterday. ENPH is a short I mentioned Thursday and the alerts I set have been triggered this morning. It is also at the top of Heavy Selling search this morning. It breached a Low+ two days ago and today it is breaching multiple Low- lines. This video was recorded 50 minutes after the open and the link takes you right to that moment.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/hRg6to-os2I?t=1362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here to watch me do this analysis real-time in a video as it is unfolding</a>.</p>

<p>ENPH easily breached the prior day’s low. The D1 is weak and the volume is super heavy. It took out the prior day’s low with ease and it did not retrace any of that first long red candle even though the market tried to bounce. The stock tried to get off the deck on the market hod, but it was instantly spanked down. This is a good short and I have a market tailwind.</p>

<p>To this point, position sizing has not even remotely been considered. If you are trading 1 share, take the trade. It is going to be one that gets you closer to your 75% win rate. As the trade unfolds, you look for signs of confirmation and you imagine where you might have added and where you might take gains. What are the signs you will look for that tell you if it is a good trade or a bad one? What is the market doing? Is the stock preserving its relative weakness? When I decided to exit, how did I do? Record the trade in the log with your observations. Then review your trades after the close. You are going to get blindsided by market moves and wild stock bounces. At this stage of the learning process, you are going to make mistakes. It is critically important to keep them small. When you are trading 1 share, you are not worried about those mistakes because they are not going to impact you financially. Your complete focus is on reading the market and finding the best stocks. Your observations of what happened to the trade are going to be critical to your future growth.</p>
<p>So how would I have approached the trade? Again, this is my personality and this is my style. It is not going to be anyone else’s style. Our experience level is different, our capital base is different, and our risk tolerance is different. Our long-term and short-term market bias is different, our long-term and short-term opinion of the stock is different and our confidence in our analysis is different. My approach is optimal for me at this exact time and for this specific stock and it will not be the same for anyone else.</p>
<p>The market is giving back the gains from yesterday, but the volume is lighter on a relative basis. We are still early in the day and this move should be decent because the range for the day is still being established. We are in the “sweet spot” (45 min after the open + 2 hours), the 1OP bearish cycle just started so I have the entire cycle to work with. The SPY low of the day failed easily and it is below the major MAs. ENPH is extremely weak. The ATR is $12 so it should be able to get to $185 with this market tailwind. I should be able to conservatively make $3 on this move with a 90% probability and a very small chance of losing money given the backdrop. Short shares, you don’t need to mess with options. You do not plan on swing trading, so you need to be able to get in and out quickly. Start with a half position and add quickly if the SPY stacks another red. If it does, you will have a market tailwind for an hour and you should be able to make a few grand. If the SPY stalls quickly, don’t add to ENPH. Stick with the original. That would be a sign of market support. We already know the SPY volume is not great and this is a triple witch. This is also likely to be and “inside day” so once the SPY low is in the price action will die down. OK. SPY stacked another red, short the other half of ENPH. The stock is weak and it can’t get off the deck. It is leaking oil. This is a volatile stock so I am going to take partial gains if I see a long red candle. OK. Took partial gains on that long red candle and I did better than expected. The SPY bearish cycle is ending and the SPY is starting to find support. I’ve already taken partial gains so just watching to see what the SPY does here. 1OP bullish cross and mixed overlapping candles for SPY. The market is finding support here. The stock continues to drift lower so I can still ride the position. SPY made a marginal new low and the 1OP bullish cycle is starting to produce green candles. The stock is compressing at the lod. This is going to be an “inside day” and this was probably the move of the day. Take remaining gains on ENPH.</p>
<p>This is the thought process. The position size and trade management happened during the trade. Based on all of the information that was presented at that time, I made a decision to short ENPH. I set my expectations and the degree of certainty. That did not mean that the trade was going to unfold in the best possible manner, so I scaled in and waited for confirmation. My game plan included where I would add and under what conditions. It also included when I would take partial profits and when I would eventually exit the trade. If you showed me this exact same stock just a few hours later, my approach would have been (and was) completely different. In the spirit of the Tom Brady analogy, this is the first half of the game. We are constantly evaluating during the day and we are basing our decisions on the current information.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Another_Example">Another Example</h2>
<p>Are we done? No, the trading day is not over so let’s keep going. What have I learned to this point? The market is weak, support has been established, the heavier volume has come on the drops and the SPY is back below all of the major moving averages, this is going to be an “inside day” and we have probably seen the move of the day. I prefer trading from the short side given this back drop. I have too much shit to do so I don’t have time to highlight longs in the chat room. If I did, they would be in the tech sector and they would only be scalps. For most members, the better lesson would be to teach them patience on a day like this. Highlighting longs will only encourage them to trade them. They should only focus on the short side and they should patiently wait for the next set-up. When the next window of opportunity surfaces, I will start to post again. These comments were all in the chat room on 3/17/23.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>Two hours before the close our next window of opportunity surfaced. The SPY bounce hit resistance at the VWAP and the first attempt to get through it culminated with a bearish hammer. This told me that sellers were in control. During the next hour the price action dried up and the candles were tiny. 1OP had been grinding higher and it finally got back to zero. This was slightly bearish. We started to see more wicks on attempts to get the SPY above the VWAP. It was time to look for a weak stock. It was late in the day and this was going to be a small trade. There was no reason to get aggressive during compressed light volume price action. I have no intention of holding anything overnight, so I have to be extra selective and respect my stop. I am going to enter all at once with smaller size than the ENPH trade and I want a setup where I can make $1,000 without pressing too hard. The market lod should hold so I will take gains on signs of support. ENPH is dead, so I will check the RelWeak30 search for stocks that have been weak during the market bounce.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>DG was a nice candidate. The D1 chart was weak. The stock was already below all of the major MAs. It was breaking major Low+ and Low- trendlines on heavy volume and it had a long red candle the previous day. So what? That was the day the SPY surged higher on heavy volume and the stock did not participate (sign of selling pressure and relative weakness). Upon closer inspection, DG had earnings before the open Thursday (“B” on the chart) and the reaction was negative. The M5 chart for DG was also weak. When the market bounced, the stock was barely able to get off of the low of the day. This was a sign that sellers were keeping a lid on it. Any market weakness and this stock should crumble. Now I just have to wait for confirmation that the market is going to roll over. Bearish 1OP cross for SPY M5 and a couple of red candles. Stock dropped. Short the lod for DG. The ATR is $4.70 and we should still have a buck in this trade. The market has been compressing and the volume is light. There is no reason to think that there is enough fire power for the market to make a new low this late in the day. If the SPY stalls at the lod, I am going to take gains on DG and call it a week. SPY has tiny bodied candles at the lod, SPY bearish cycle ending and no SPY volume spike on the drop. The SPY lod is going to hold. DG is at its ATR, take gains on the DG short.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Plan_Adapt">Plan &amp; Adapt</h2>
<p>This is how position sizing and trade management work. They are dynamic and they happen in real-time. We don’t have a machine that cranks out the optimal position size before the open and the perfect entry and exit points for any trade are not known. You are constantly evaluating the market and the stocks you might trade. During the trade you are deciding if you should add or take profits. You are revising your expectations and your game plan as the action unfolds. Although I used day trades to illustrate the point, the same concepts apply to swing trading.</p>
<p>Belichick and Brady devised game plans ahead of time and they knew the matchups they wanted to exploit. However, the game does not always go according to plan. They watch and they gather information. Then they adapted during the game. Every game is different and so is every market day.</p>
<p>I was perfectly willing to go into Friday with a long mindset. The previous day was strong and the rally took place on heavy volume. The SPY closed above all of the major moving averages. After 30 minutes of trading, it was obvious that I needed to look for shorts. Would this turn into a bearish Gap and Go? I didn’t know so I evaluated along the way. What took hours to write took me seconds to recognize. Click, click, click… there’s a nice short. You know instantly from looking at the set up how much you can make and with what degree of likelihood. All of the inputs tell you how aggressive you can be or how passive you should be. Where to add, where to set targets and when to bail on the trade are determined by your analysis, your level of confidence in that analysis and the price action as the trade unfolds. Every trader has their own risk tolerance and this is where you will develop your trading personality. You will use various methods for scaling in or out and you will have your favorite options strategies. These are the final brush strokes to the trade. Before you start worrying about position sizing, get your win rate to 75% for a few months straight trading one share. Focus on getting the market right D1 and M5 and on finding the best stocks D1 and M5. This is going to take a couple of years and without even knowing it, you will be developing the skills you will need for trade management and position sizing.</p>
