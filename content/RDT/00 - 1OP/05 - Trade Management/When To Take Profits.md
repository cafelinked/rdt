<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In this article, we are going to discuss exit strategies when the trade is working out.</h4>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>You are in a nice trade and the market and the stock are behaving as you expected. The gains are mounting and you are nervous. You don’t want to lose what you’ve made, but you don’t want to exit too early and leave a lot of money “on the table.” In this article, we will explore the decision-making process and some of the strategies you can use. For simplicity’s sake, we are going to talk about a bullish market backdrop and a strong stock. The same concepts apply to the short side. This article focuses on winning trades. If you need help with stops, please <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/trade-management/where-to-place-stops/">read that article</a>.</p>
<p>Every trade starts with a game plan. You’ve done your market analysis and your stock analysis. The checkboxes are marked and you have defined your level of confidence. It will determine your trade size and if you are trading options, your strategy. Your expectations are set. “If the market does this… and the stock does this… I will know that I am in a good trade. If the market does this… and the stock does this… I will know that I am in a bad trade.” Those parameters (good and bad) are defined before you enter. </p>
<p>Market first! There will be times when your SPY confidence is high, but it might not be directional. For instance, the market has been trapped in a 60-day range and it is compressing. “I am confident that the market is NOT going to drop and if anything, it is going to breakout.” In this example, you would reduce the size of your bullish positions because you do not have a market tailwind. The stock will have to do all of the work. You will need to watch the price action of the stock very carefully. When the momentum wanes, you won’t get any help from the market. If your market confidence is high and the SPY is trending, you will trade larger size and your options strategies will favor call buying. You are expecting the market rally to fuel the move in the underlying stock. If the stock pauses, the strong market will provide a safety net so the pullbacks in the stock will be brief and shallow. Once recent gains have been digested, the buyers will return and the stock will stage the next leg of the rally. In the first scenario, you were not leaning very heavily on market strength because it was in a compression. That means you will be less sensitive to the market chopping around in the range and you will not be as dependent on major economic releases or “Fed speak.” In the second scenario, you are leaning on the market momentum and you are expecting it to continue. You are trading larger size so you need confirmation that the market is holding up its end of the bargain. As long as the trend is intact, you stay the course. You are aware of major market moving news and you adjust risk ahead of those events.</p>
<p>The market is the top consideration for exiting trades and most traders don’t even consider it. That’s why I put it at the top of the list. If you are expecting the market to stay in a trading range and if you are trading average size and/or selling out of the money bullish put spreads, you are not as sensitive to market moves. If the market breaks below the lower end of the compression with a long red candle and heavy volume, you are aware of the move, but you do not have to be overly concerned until you see follow through selling. During this market move, you are watching your stocks. Did they hold strong during the market dip? If they did, you know they have relative strength. On any market bounce back into the range, the stock will also move higher. If the stock was very sensitive to the market move, it could be a sign that it is starting to lose its momentum. If the market continues to move lower, you are ready to exit the stock if it has become relatively weak. </p>
<p>If the market is in a strong uptrend and you are trading larger size, you are counting on that strength. You need to monitor the price action of SPY and you do not want to see any patterns that might suggest resistance. The stock might still look extremely strong, but the market is starting to falter. You are willing to “weather” a brief and small market pullback, but you do not want it to be organized (consecutive red candles). If the stock is easily shedding gains, you should take some of the position off. When the market regains its footing, a stock that weathered the soft patch beautifully confirms its strength and you might consider adding to the position. If there are major economic releases pending (i.e. jobs report), and the market has recently had bad reactions, reduce risk. You can always re-enter if the reaction is bullish. You are aggressively long because your confidence in the stock and the market is high. You can’t afford to get blindsided. Remember, we are trading the market and we are riding the “fastest horse.”</p>
<p>Let’s start with a trade I highlighted in my <a href="https://youtu.be/TmnlcUOMzPM?si=7KmebYfzxAazrDE-&amp;t=1178" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a> on 12/27.23. In that video, I went through my market analysis and, although I was bullish, I felt that we could see a small market dip to start the year after a huge market run up. My confidence was high and I felt that any dip would be brief and shallow. We were likely to see some profit taking so I did NOT want to buy calls. I was looking for a stock that had a nice technical breakout and that had high option IVs. SNOW fit the bill and I suggested selling the SNOW (Jan 19) $185/182.50 bullish put spread for $.50 Credit. If the market dipped, the stock was likely to dip. I could tell that from the previous price action. It had horizontal support at the breakout, support at AVWAPE and horizontal support at $185. This spread would expire in 3 weeks so I would have time decay working in my favor while the market digested gains.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SNOW020424-1024x670.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="b806a5a7-ed8f-41dd-b323-fe086b8f6910">

                        <div class="h6 fst-italic mt-3 mt-md-0 ms-md-4 gallery-caption"></div>
                    </div>
                
<p>So how did the trade turn out? As suspected, the market did dip during the first week of the year. The move featured tiny bodied candles with wicks and tails so the move was NOT organized or strong. SNOW dropped with the market and it tested support at $185. This was all part of the game plan so there was no need to panic out of the trade. I intentionally gave the trade room to move around and it was consistent with my market expectations and my expectations for the stock. In one day, the market recaptured all of the losses for the year and the stock shot higher. If the stock did not rebound, it would be a sign of weakness and I would have to consider stopping the trade out. The market regained its footing and so did the stock. The spread expired and generated a 25% return on margin. </p>

                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/snow020424a-875x1024.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="f846f62f-d43c-460d-aa6e-15b3fa42b0d5">

                    </div>
                
<p>In the above example, the stock did what we expected so we stayed with the position. In this next example, the market had broken through all of the major moving averages, AVWAPQ and a High- trendline. It had long green candles on heavy volume and gaps higher that never filled. There were barely any red candles, and this was an incredibly strong rebound off of a recent low. JPM had similar characteristics. My market confidence was extremely high and it was directional (up). My confidence in JPM was also very high and I expected it and the market to power higher. The strategy was to buy longer-term calls and you can see the original analysis from 11/19/23 <a href="https://youtu.be/EiSzddKfVTY?si=KaEJ_ifpW91chWhI&amp;t=546" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this YouTube video</a>. We wanted at least 6 weeks until expiration and we selected the JPM Jan (19) $145 calls for $10.50. We wanted a high delta of .7 and we wanted the options to span earnings.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jpm020424-1024x849.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="3d75b142-2dc4-4794-abf8-5dba4d0cfdb9">
                            <img src="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jpm020424-1024x849.png" alt="">

                    </div>
                
<p>As the trade unfolded, the market kept marching higher as expected. Every red SPY candle along the way was erased immediately and buyers were aggressive. That is why we did not see any dips. Given this market price action, we expected JPM to perform well and it did. In the chart below, you can see the consecutive stacked green candles on heavy volume. The stock had incredible relative strength and even when the market dipped, JPM continued to grind higher. Those $145 calls were almost $30 in the money and there was no reason to exit the trade. The market and the stock continued to perform and you should have been adding to the position along the way.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jpm020424a-1024x912.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="38d9de3e-ab0c-422c-9022-6e01f21cec60">

                    </div>
                
<p>Where would you add to the position? Every time the market had a red candle that was instantly reversed, you could have added because JPM never flinched. Those down days are very important because they give us an opportunity to gauge the strength of the stock relative to the market and they give us a chance to gauge the level of profit taking in the overall market. In this case, dips were instantly erased and that was a sign of strong buying pressure. </p>
<p>The market drives all of our decisions and it is the cornerstone for any trade. When it is volatile and directionless, we trade smaller size. When it is flat and trapped in a range, we trade smaller size and we lean more on the strength of the stock. When the market is trending, we are more aggressive and we have to watch for changes in momentum. Compressions are fine after a nice run and they are a sign of strength. Buyers were lined up and there was never a dip. We want the compression to last less than two weeks. Dips need to be brief (8-10 bars) and shallow (more than half of the move since the last dip is preserved). We look for confirmation along the way and we want to see red candles turn into bullish hammers during the move. We want to see red candles from the prior day erased immediately the next day. As long as we have these characteristics, we are confident that the market is going to fuel our trade and not work against it. If the market conditions change, we need to be ready to exit the trade.</p>
<p>There will be moments when the market has a temporary hiccup, but the stock remains extremely strong. Such was the case with the JPM trade above. You can stick with the trade, but you want the market to recover quickly. This is the “edge” and the relative strength in the stock allowed us to weather the “squall.” In fact, we like the stock position even more because it held firm during the market drop and that confirms the strength. The market rebounds and we are back on track.</p>
<p>First let’s take a look at a typical stock that is in a steady grind higher. It is strong, but it has plenty of retracements and dips along the way. On the left side of the chart below. you will see the letter ‘B.” That signifies earnings before the open and the stock gapped down. As it sold off, you can see the stair-step drop. That is important because it tells us the type of price action we can expect. It finds support and it rallies above the 200-day MA and AVWAPE. This is where we start watching for a trend reversal and an opportunity to buy. The stock hits resistance and at the arrow labeled 1. and it pulls back to the 100-day MA. The breakout above the 100-day MA would be a good entry point because the stock is also in the D1 gap referenced earlier. We know we can expect a bumpy ride because that is how the stock trades. At the arrow labeled 2. the stock pulls back, but it finds support above the 100-day MA. This is important because it tells us that buyers are eager and they never let it test that support. The red bearish engulfing candle is erased the next day and the stock is back on track. It continues to fill the gap and you can see how the stock closes strong before earnings at the very end of the chart. There really was no reason to exit the trade. The stock temporarily lost its relative strength along the way, but the selling pressure was contained to “solo” red bars that were immediately erased. This is not the strongest of set-ups, but that is how we would trade it.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Choppy-grind-higher-888x1024.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="485a347c-71a4-4689-a7a6-9c6176133fc7">

                    </div>
                
<p>In this next example, we will take a look at an intraday chart. Remember, the same technical concepts apply across any time frame M5 – D1. The market is trapped in a range and the volume is light. We’ve seen mixed overlapping candles and it is an <a href="https://oneoption.com/the-system/market-first/short-term-technical/flat-open/">“Inside Day.”</a> By now, you should know that this is a low probability trading environment for day trading, and you need to temper your expectations. You set passive targets and you take what you can get. In the example below, the market bounced off of support, and when it did so, the stock did not bounce. The selling pressure for the stock had been heavy earlier in the day and we can see that from the stacked red candles on heavy volume. It was compressing (shaded area) and on the next market dip, this would be a good short. When we have very steep drops, we should expect that support will be found earlier in the day because the selling has been extreme and the stock has taken a beating already. The bounces can be violent because buyers are interested at that low price. The point is that the stock might have one more leg lower, but we need to be ready to take gains because it has already dropped so far. Plus, we have a sideways market. In this case, the stock dropped as we expected. When we got the nice long red candle, it was time to take gains. In this instance, you do not wait around. Those were really nice gains on a dull day. What more can you expect? I often hear, “I can’t make money in this sideways market.” Yes you can, you just need to adjust your expectations. This is NOT a day where you can just let the stock run. If the stock had a less severe drop from the start of the day and if it was just drifting lower all day you could stick with it. I will provide an example.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">
                        <a href="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/amd020724.png" class="gallery-item rounded-3" data-lg-id="cc2951c8-f3b1-4b08-94f9-a11a21b23afa">
                            <img src="https://oneoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/amd020724.png" alt="">
                        </a>
                        <div class="h6 fst-italic mt-3 mt-md-0 ms-md-4 gallery-caption"></div>
                    </div>
                
<p>This next example is for the same day and it is an example of a stock that did not make a fast early move. The market is trapped in a range on this light volume day and it is chopping back and forth. After two hours of trading, we can see that the stock in the chart below has excellent volume and relative strength. It has been grinding higher and we notice that the stock made a new high for the day when the market dipped. This is an excellent entry point for a long and we know to temper our expectations given the market backdrop. The SPY bounces and the stock starts stacking green candles. On a day like this I know the “music” is going to stop so I am not worried about milking every last drop out of the trade. I just have to determine how much money I feel I can make on this move and I take gains into strength. In this article, I discuss a measured move and that is one technique you can use. As expected, the market bounce stalls and it tests the downside. The stock is on our radar, so we watch for relative strength. As the market continues to fall, the stock holds firm. When the market finds support, we will buy this stock again and we get another similar leg higher in the stock. As the stock starts to rally it stacks green key bars. A $1 gain on a $110 stock on a market day like this is great. Don’t wait around for signs of resistance. When the sellers return, the drop will be quick. You have to take what you can get and you will rarely sell the high. On the exit you might lament for 10 minutes that you could have sold higher, but 20 minutes later, you are happy with your exit.</p>

                    </div>
                
<p>Now let’s take a look at a few stocks during a trend day for the market. This concept applies to longer term charts as well. It takes time to identify trends and the initial move has to hold. If there is instant retracement and the entire move is erased, it was a head fake. If the move retraces, but half of it is intact, a series of higher lows will indicate that buyers are still interested and that the move up will be choppy. If all of the move is preserved and the market continues higher with very few red candles, it is a sign that a bullish trend is underway. Ideally, the move comes on heavy volume and technical resistance has been breached. This is an over-simplification, but it can be used as a rough guideline. Longer-term context plays an important role as well. How long does it take to confirm a trend is underway? For day trading, usually an hour. For D1 charts I would use 10-12 periods. The advantage to trading when you have a strong market trend is that you have staying power. You don’t have to worry about dips because you know based on prior price action that they will be brief and shallow. When we have confirmation that the dips are brief and shallow, we know that buyers are engaged and that the next leg higher is about to begin. This is where we can add to the position. We continue to add and ride positions until the market shows signs of resistance (compression, bearish hammer or a bearish engulfing candle). This is where you take gains and reduce risk. We are trading the market and we are riding the fastest horse (stocks). Yes, this is where you start taking gains on stocks. Stocks that are still moving higher you can hold on to but have a support level in mind for a stop (or a time frame). Exit stocks that did not participate in the last leg of the market rally. Here are some examples.</p>
<p>As I just explained, it takes an hour of price action or more to identify when the market is in a trend day. Nice tight SPY price action with lots of green candles on good volume through technical resistance are the “tells” to watch for. We don’t want long mixed candles or long wicks/tails. Those are signs of volatility. The next 3 charts use the same day. The market backdrop is strong and this is going to be a trend day and we know that after 90 minutes of trading. The stock below made a swift move higher right on the open. It had overlapping candles and long tails so that was a sign that the move was not that strong. As the market continues to move higher, the stock starts to crown (left side of chart). That is fine during a bullish trend day for the market, because we have staying power. On a normal “non-trending” day we would take profits here. The market dips and so does the stock. It pulled back pretty hard and it traded below VWAP. No worries, we are expecting the market to rally and when it does, the stock should make a new high for the day. During the initial stages of the market rally, the stock continued to compress. This is not ideal. The strongest of stocks will start to climb even before the market finds support. The stock surges higher and it makes a new high for the day (middle of chart). As the market continues to move higher, the stock pulls back. When the market makes a new high for the day, the stock makes a lower high double top. It is time to take gains. The exit is not determined by anything more than what the stock is doing relative to the market. </p>

<p>Using the same market day as a reference, the stock in this next example gaps higher on heavy volume. The relative strength is incredible and it even continues higher when the market starts to dip. We have no issues holding on to this stock on a bullish trend day. It has traveled more than the 20-day average true range (ATR), but sometimes stocks will move well beyond that. There is no harm in holding this stock and we will know what to do when the market bounces. As you can see, the stock “fired all of its bullets” in the first two hours of trading and there was no more gas left in the tank. As the market continued to move higher, the stock compressed and it was not able to get back to the high of the day. The issue with buying “hot” stocks that surge early in the day is that we don’t know if the market is in a trend day, the risk of the stock giving back much of the gains is high and we never have time to add to the position. We don’t want to chase so we are stuck with an initial position that does well, but we miss a great market move for the remainder of the day. If your capital is tight, take gains and find something else that is moving. If you have plenty of capital, you can hold the position and see if the stock gains momentum later in the day. In the last hour of trading, the stock did finish on the high of the day when the market pulled back. This is a sign that late day profit taking by short-term traders was soaked up by longer-term buyers and there is a good chance the stock will continue higher. </p>

<p>In this final example from the same bullish trend day, we have a boring old stock that opens flat and that gradually and consistently moves higher. It did not gap up so it is not over-extended. The retracements are very minor and as the market dips, it is oblivious to the selling and it continues to grind higher. You can add when the stock makes a new high for the day. It is not ahead of itself and we are not chasing. When the market finds support the stock is making a new high for the day. This is where you can buy more stock and as the market moves higher, we expect the stock to continue to grind higher. That is exactly what happened and we want to get our position on early so that we can ride the move up. This is a great situation because we are in complete control during the entire move. We have time to identify the market trend day and the stock is not surging higher so we have plenty of opportunities to add without feeling like we are chasing. Because the price action has been orderly, the dips should be minimal. Large spikes attract profit taking and that results in volatility. “Grinders” are great because you can get aggressive with this pattern on a bullish trend day. As the move unfolds you can see that the market continues higher and the stock compresses at the high of the day (middle of the chart). This is a sign that the stock is getting tired and that on the final market push higher, you should consider taking gains in the stock, especially if the stock only musters a marginal new high. Start scaling out into strength. You have a fairly large position at this stage. The red bearish engulfing candle is where you would exit the remaining position.</p>

<p>In general, this is how the market impacts our entry and exit. We don’t want big market gaps up when the market is trending higher. Many of those gaps will reverse and taking early longs is risky for that reason. All stocks shoot higher and it is harder to identify relative strength. A “Gap and Go” is fairly rare and the real ones are typically news related. We are waiting for signs that the move is legitimate and the market surges higher before we have confirmation. Most of the gains are realized for the entire day during the first 90 minutes. If we wait for confirmation, we miss most of the move. If we chase, we run the risk of a reversal. This is not a good risk/reward set-up for us. A flat open is fine, it gives us time to evaluate stocks with relative strength. We watch for signs that the market might be trapped in a range “Inside Day” and we trade as if that is going to happen with starter positions. If the stock can get through the prior day high early in the day and if the volume is strong and other D1 resistance (MAs, trendlines…) has been breached, this has a chance to turn into a bullish trend day. The price action will be tight and orderly, and we can add to our starter positions. A gap down in an upward trending market is a gift. During the initial drop, relative strength will be easier to spot. Provided that the move lower is not too deep (&lt; 20-day ATR) and that there are mixed overlapping candles (weak down trend) the market will find support and we will have a great entry. The market has the potential to fill much if not all of the gap. You take starter positions on support in the strongest stocks and you add when the market makes a new high for the day (it is in the gap). You continue to add to the positions as long as the stock is grinding higher and as long as the market continues to move higher in an orderly fashion. In the diagram below, you can see how stocks that surge higher (upper left corner) offer limited upside when the market is flat. They stage an initial surge higher and in a best case scenario, they tread water. They do not have a market tail wind to fuel the move. “FOMO Joe” will chase the heck out of these on the open and they will reverse sharply. Ask yourself, “Why is the stock worth so much more today?” If there was no material news, it is all technically based. There is limited upside and the move can easily reverse. This is a bad risk/reward set-up. If the stock grinds higher (upper right corner) in a flat market (or on a market that gaps down), this is a nice display of relative strength and we can take a starter position with a fairly high degree of confidence. The market won’t help or hinder. When the market starts to show signs of resistance below the prior high of the day, consider taking gains. Operate under the assumption early on that resistance is going to hold. If the market breaks out, you can always get back in. There will be days when the market does start to trend higher (lower right corner) and the “grinder” will continue. Those positions are easy to add to and you want to do so in the first half of the day. The remainder of the day, you are just going to ride the move and wait for signs of exhaustion in the stock or the market. Stocks that surge higher (lower left corner) might give us an early opportunity to enter, but we are on “pins and needles” wondering if the stock move is legitimate and if the market is going to trend. While we are waiting for market confirmation, the stock continues to move higher and we don’t have a chance to add because we are chasing. The stock has exhausted most of its upside. We can hold the position since the relative strength is good and we expect it to move higher when the market finds support. Most of the time, the stock does not have any gas left in the tank. In conclusion, nice orderly opens for the market and grinding stocks present the best opportunities for us.</p>

<p>I could have broken out the impact the market has on our exits in a separate article, but then its importance would be diminished. You would focus on the other stock patterns and exit concepts below. Make no mistake… the market is the primary factor for deciding when to enter and when to exit the strongest stocks. Market first, market first, market first. For the rest of this article, we are only going to focus on the stock itself. The market is doing exactly what we expected, and we are going to take our clues from the stock.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="oo__Problem_Child_">“Problem Child”</h2>
<p>Not every trade goes as expected and this was my only bad pick from Q4 2023. We can learn just as much from our bad trades as we can from the good ones, and I highlighted this one on YouTube (11/19/23). You can click here to <a href="https://youtu.be/vTiWoL3UYQM?si=wqNa7modfLexzrnV&amp;t=1460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch my analysis</a>. Before we enter a trade, we have to form a game plan that outlines what we expect the market to do and the stock to do. We also have to determine the conditions that would tell us when we are wrong. The market was very strong and my confidence was high that a D1 up trend was in place. Disney (DIS) also looked good. It had a nice breakout through a High- trendline, it gapped up after earnings, it was through all of the major moving averages, and it was above AVWAPE. I wanted the stock to hold the gap. It had run pretty far so I did not want to get super aggressive with it. The stock was choppy, so I sold an out of the money bullish put spread (92.50/90 for $.50 credit) to give it some room to move around. The stock had good relative strength and all of the checkboxes were marked. I expected the market to continue higher and I expected the stock to hold the gap and to possibly move higher. The market did as I expected, but the stock dropped below the gap. I was expecting that level to hold. Since this was a swing trade, I did not have to panic on the first long red candle. The stock was still close to that support and if it bounced, the position might still be alright. That outcome would also serve as confirmation of support. During the next few days, the market moved higher and the stock was not able to recover. This was a sign of selling pressure so I took my lumps. What did I miss? The box office receipts for two new Disney movies during Thanksgiving did not perform well. This is not news I would typically search for, but when it comes to Disney… I will in the future. The stock did not perform as I expected and that was why I exited the trade.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Measured_Move">Measured Move</h2>
<p>A method I sometimes use is called a measured move. It is a pretty basic concept where you take the range (high minus low) from a previous move and you add it to the high. That would represent how far the stock might travel before it hits resistance. If you see a compression or a bearish candle, you take gains, and it is a sign that the move will rest at that point. When you exit, set an alert line at the high. If there is a compression breakout, you might want to get back in. You can also set alerts in Option Stalker Pro for LRSI (or other indicators). Gauge which time frame would have triggered in the previous drop. When the indicator cycles (bullish to bearish to bullish) you will get an alert. Then you evaluate the dip. If it was brief and shallow, you might have a nice entry point for the next leg higher. As the stock moves up your alert at the previous high will also trigger and you can add to the position. How do I pick these boxes? Which one is the right one? Which one is the best one? <strong>Stop.</strong> Every stock behaves differently. If you can look at a chart and identify cycles like the ones below, use the method. If you can’t, find another method you can use to set targets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Grinder">Grinder</h2>
<p>These stocks are in a nice orderly grind higher. They have tiny dips, if any at all, and they are oblivious to market moves. They have relative strength and they do not have many stacked green candles. These moves can continue for a very long time and as I described earlier, you can add to the position every time the stock weathers a market dip because you have confirmation that buyers are still interested. These are moves you can ride higher and you do not want to be shaken out. Conventional methods like using the EMA 8 or a trailing stop will force you to exit the trade prematurely. Eventually, the candle bodies will become tiny and the momentum will wane. Typically, the volume will also dry up and the stock will start to lose its relative strength. When you see a compression, take gains and set a price alert at the top of the compression. The stock might just need time to digest gains and this way you will know when it is back on track.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="High_Flier">High-Flier</h2>
<p>As the old saying goes, “The bigger they are, the harder they fall.” These stocks are stacking green candles on volume and they have incredible relative strength. The move is fast and you feel like you are chasing. The rug can get pulled out from under you at any time, so you typically just get an initial position on and maybe one add if you act early. As the move unfolds, you are watching for any signs of weakness. You have big gains and that rightfully makes you nervous. First of all, good that you are not chasing the stock. If you missed the initial D1 move, you can always day trade the stock and catch some of the move. This is particularly true as the move extends and the risk of a reversal increases. Swing traders need to take comfort knowing that the pullbacks are brief and shallow and that the volume is still good. These moves typically end with a bang. When you see a bearish hammer with a long wick at a relative high or a bearish engulfing candle, take gains on the entire position. You did not add at higher levels and you did not chase. You kept your position size manageable, so your emotions did not cloud your judgement. You had monster gains and you did not take gains prematurely. Not all of these trades will reach the heights of the chart below, but some will. Wait for that red candle and hold the line. If you ride one of these the whole way, pat yourself on the back. Not many traders catch the entire move.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Channels">Channels</h2>
<p>Some stocks have a random, choppy feel to them and you can’t even see a pattern to the price action. Every time the stock rallies to a new high, it pulls back. When you sense this, zoom out. Often the stock will be in a longer-term trend, but the bid is constantly tested. For upward sloping trends, I like to focus on the upper line first. If I can connect at least a few points I have a decent trendline. Then I will look for a lower line that is roughly parallel to the upper line. It does not have to be perfect and if there are a couple of “outliers,” that is OK as far as I am concerned. This is your trading channel and it gives you clarity. Now you can see the pattern. Before I go any further, this is not the type of stock I like to trade. I like the previous chart much better, and I seek nice steady price action. One approach to this type of stock is that you can sell out of the money bullish put spreads when the stock is near the low end of the trading channel. The black line is the 200-day MA and that would set up really well. I would not be more aggressive with a stock like this because I don’t know when it will take off and when it will pullback. If you are long a stock like this and if you notice a trading channel, you have to watch breakouts above the upper trendline very closely. These are often buying climaxes and the stock is ready to drop hard back into the channel. If there is no follow through, take gains before it falls back into the channel.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Dips">Dips</h2>
<p>Some stocks are just choppier than others and that is something you need to be aware of if you are trading them. We want the dips to be brief and shallow. What does that mean? Personally, I want the dip to last less than 8-10 bars and I want half of the most recent move higher to be preserved. Each subsequent dip should end sooner and be less severe. That is a sign that buyers are getting more aggressive. In the chart below, you can see that this stock dips with frequency. That is its character and when you enter the trade, that needs to be a part of your game plan. It is not going to go straight up, and you are going to have to weather some of these. You can see how the dips were getting smaller (left side) before earnings and there was a nice trade on the breakout. After a big earnings jump (right side), you would not want to jump on that breakout. This stock has a history of dips and it will need a couple of weeks to prove that the gains are going to hold. It pulls back to the earnings announcement price and then it rallies above AVWAPE and a bullish flag forms. We know this is not going to be a straight shot higher and the stock retraces. This would flush most traders out, but you are expecting it. The stock quickly finds support. The dip is brief and shallow and the stock surges higher. There are “tells” that the dip is going to be brief and shallow. There are no long red candles and the red candles are fairly small in size. Ideally, the retracement features mixed overlapping candles and it is stubborn. Sometimes the dip will be influenced by a market dip and that is even better. If not for market weakness, the stock might not have dipped at all. You can use measured moves to exit or you can ride the move higher as long as horizontal support holds. The most recent breakout becomes your support. That was your entry and a drop below it would stop you out for close to a scratch. Each dip also creates a nice low point to anchor a trendline and you can use a breach below it for an exit as well. If the dips become more severe and they last longer, the stock could be getting ready for a trend reversal. Personally, if the dips are shorter and shallower, I will buy a bullish flag breakout and I will take gains at a measured move. I am more of a hit and run trader and I don’t like weathering dips/weakness. This is just a personal preference.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Double_Top">Double Top</h2>
<p>A double top where both peaks are equal signal resistance, but an even more powerful pattern is a double top lower high. Before the stock can even challenge the previous high, sellers pound the stock down. They are aggressive and they don’t believe the stock will get back to that prior high. The bounce to get back to the prior high is weak with mixed overlapping candles and there are wicks. The wicks represent an attempt to get back to the high and that move is hammered down by sellers. This is an important topic so please take note. In the chart below, we can see a nice breakout (left side). The stock is choppy and we expect dips. If you bailed on each of these dips, you missed the move higher. They were brief and shallow. The price action before the high was not incredibly strong. We know that from the constant dips and the lack of stacked green candles. There are a few “stacked greens,” but nothing like we have seen in other charts. The price action tells us to expect dips. How do we know when the high has been reached? In any longer-term rally, there will be dips. The stock has not gone parabolic, so we are not over-extended. The first dip that does not recover and make a new high is where we have to exit. In the first two dips below, notice how they were followed by long green candles that obliterated the prior high. On the dip off of the high (right side), notice how the candles on the way down were more substantial and red. On the bounce, the candles were tiny and mixed. We also saw wicks above the candle. Every time the stock tried to challenge the high, the stock was pounded down. Almost every bull rally will have a double top lower high like this. There are clues everywhere. During the last leg of the rally, the moves higher will be marginal. There will be mixed overlapping candles and the gains will be hard fought. The drops during the dip will be more severe and they will last longer. The attempt to get back to the high will be squashed. You don’t have to worry about the rug getting pulled out from a longer-term bull rally (SPY or a stock) until you see this lower high double top. During that drop from the high, don’t bail. You will always get a bounce. Sometimes the rebound will feature stacked green candles and a new high and sometimes you will get a double top lower high. It is worth it to see which one you get. On the bounce, the stock (or SPY) will get fairly close to the prior high so your losses will not be that great.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Long_Candles">Long Candles</h2>
<p>A long candle has a body that is greater than the 20-day ATR by my definition. They stick out like a sore thumb on a chart. When the stock breaks out on a long green candle, we want at least half of it to hold. The same holds true during the middle of the move higher. Those long “greens” will attract profit taking. When the entire candle holds, it is more bullish than if only half of it holds. That is a sign of aggressive buying. Often, we will see a pause for a day or two after the long green candle before the move higher continues. We do NOT want to see those green candles “given back.” If this happens, it is a sign that the long green candle was a buying climax and that the selling pressure is high. Long red candles are always a threat during a rally. They will come near a relative high. In some cases, the red candle will be a head fake (“solo”) to spark profit taking. If the red candle is erased immediately, it confirms that buyers are still in control and that the move higher is going to continue. You can see them in strong trends and the long “red” that came at a relative high is way back in the middle of the trend by the time the rally has ended. You can see that in the chart below. Each red candle that is reversed confirms the strength of the rally. If the red candle holds the low and the stock can’t recapture it, sellers are aggressive. Any additional red candles need to be respected and it is time to exit the position.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Resistance_Levels">Resistance Levels</h2>
<p>Major moving averages, AVWAPE, horizontal resistance and trendlines are all overhead barriers for a stock that is trying to move higher. The fact that the stock is below these levels in the first place signals weakness. We do not want to buy weak stocks, we want to buy strong stocks that have minimal overhead resistance and that have “blue sky” ahead. If you are long a stock and it is approaching one of these resistance points, it needs to obliterate them with a long green candle. The harder it has to struggle to get through resistance, the more likely it is to hold. How the stock approaches those levels will often tell us if it has the strength to blow through them. A stock rally that has dips along the way and mixed overlapping candles is less likely to pass through these resistance levels. You can see that in the first chart below. The move higher is not very strong and it has difficulty passing through resistance. In the second chart below, you can see examples of great breakouts through resistance. The approach features stacked green candles on heavy volume and the stock passes quickly through all of these levels. This is a good breakout on the left side and on the right side of the same chart, you can see a nice breakdown. We can take action on these breakouts/breakdowns.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Major_Events">Major Events</h2>
<p>Stocks move on news and you need to be aware of earnings, earnings by peers, Investor Conferences, new product releases, clinical trials, legislature and pending litigation. If an event is approaching that could have a material impact on earnings, it is best to exit the trade and wait for the news and reaction. Earlier in this article, I mentioned that I missed the box office receipts for DIS. This is a good example of a loss that could have been avoided.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="RS_RW">RS/RW</h2>
<p>The stock needs to preserve its D1 relative strength. When that starts to wane, we lose our edge. It is a sign that buyers are not as aggressive as they once were. First you will see the shorter-time frames turn relatively weak and then you will see the longer time frames flip. When you are long a stock, you will see the market moving higher without the stock. This is a good time to exit and to find a “fresh horse.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Sectors_Groups">Sectors &amp; Groups</h2>
<p>We often see sector rotation and when the entire group is in favor there will be a nice tailwind for all of the stocks. We don’t trade sector or group ETFs because we want to trade the strongest stock within the sector or group. The other issue with leaning too heavily on sector and group analysis is that it is difficult to categorize companies. They have many divisions that can span various industries. Is Amazon a retailer or a tech company? If it is a retailer, does it really compare well with Macy’s? The other issue with leaning heavily on sector and group analysis is that they all have different movement. Utility stocks and REITS move differently than the tech sector. With all of this in mind, it is good to know what the company does. Often we will see a big jump in a stock. You never need to chase stocks, especially if it is a stodgy old company like a food producer. They did not discover a new cure for cancer so there is no reason to chase the stock. Be patient and find your entry point. Basic material stocks and energy stocks trade based on the price of commodities. They are choppy and they will always pullback. If the stocks are in favor, wait for a dip. When you get a nice run, be ready to take gains. You know the stock dips, so exit when the momentum stalls. Companies that belong to a particular sector or group also tend to have similar dividend payments. When a company pays dividends, it tends not to be as volatile. That means you should not expect giant directional moves and it is more likely to be choppy. The chart below is Chevron. It is an Integrated Oil company. Even when it makes a decent move (blue boxes), there is plenty of retracement. We have to build that into our exit plan.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mixed_Overlapping_Candles">Mixed Overlapping Candles</h2>
<p>By now you should know that mixed overlapping candles are a sign that the trend is not that strong. If we are long, we don’t want to see this on the way up. If this starts to happen it is a sign that the momentum is starting to wane and we need to watch for a compression. That would signal to us that it is time to exit the trade. The only time we want to see mixed overlapping candles is on a dip when we are long. That would be a sign that the dip is not strong and that it is likely to be brief and shallow. It would serve as confirmation that buyers are close at hand and that support is nearby. The next leg higher will start soon.</p>
<p>This is one of the longest articles I’ve written and for a good reason. It is a very complicated subject with many variables. The most important influence on when to enter and when to exit a trade is the market. Don’t lose sight of the fact that we are trading the market using the strongest stock as a proxy. That is our edge. The long-term and short-term price action for the market determines our confidence and our position size. Stock selection is critically important and we want relative strength to the market and orderly price action. That relationship needs to be preserved. Our best risk/reward profile is to find grinders that consistently march higher. They are not over-extended, so we don’t have to weather big dips or retracements. Each time that the market stumbles and the stock does not, we have confirmation and we can add to the position. When the price action for the market and/or the price action for the stock suggest resistance, we take our gains and we wait for the next opportunity.</p>
