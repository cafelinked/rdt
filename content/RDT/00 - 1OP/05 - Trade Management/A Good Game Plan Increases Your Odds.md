<h4 class="wp-block-heading">You’ve conducted your research and you have the market context. Now it is time to devise a game plan. </h4>
<p>It is critically important to gather information and to get your market bearings. That is going to frame your trading. There will be a number of possible outcomes and you can conduct scenario analysis. Some of the outcomes will be more likely than others. Some outcomes will have a greater probability for sustained movement. Some outcomes you can trade more aggressively and some outcomes you might not want to trade at all. I am going to provide a day trading example, but the same process can be applied to any time frame. When you have a game plan you are waiting to see which scenario plays out and you are ready to execute. </p>
<p>There is a huge advantage to being proactive instead of reactive. Just like in any game, you do not want to be surprised by an outcome. When that happens you are one step behind and you are trying to avoid a disaster. When you are proactive you are anticipating the next move. You are patiently waiting for an opportunity and you are in attack mode. This is the difference between entering a trade at a good price and having instant cushion or seeing a move once it is already well underway. The proactive trader can place a stop at the entry price and they have unlimited upside to the trade with little to no downside. The reactive trader enters later and the risk is elevated because the move is already underway. Will the stock retrace and stop them out for a loss? The proactive trader is waiting for technical confirmation so that they can add to the position. The reactive trader is still waiting for that next move so that they have some cushion in the trade. Professional athletes all have one thing in common, they anticipate what is going to happen and they are one step ahead. Planning and preparation keep them at the top of their game. </p>
<p>Trades posted in the chat room are real-time examples that you can dissect and study. Why did trader “X” decide to enter that trade at that time? How did it turn out? What made the trade so attractive? How can I find that trade when it is still forming? Are there Custom Search variables that will help me find it? Was there something they saw in the market that prompted that trade? The best traders game plan and consciously or subconsciously many “checkboxes” are marked before they do a trade. By the time you see the post and by the time you enter the order, the Pros might be ready to take profits. The point is to learn from the trades. You will not find success by following someone else. Often members ask, “Why did you buy “X” at that moment?” The response typically points out some of the current technicals. They are important and obvious, but in reality, the answer is probably more involved. The trade in question is the culmination of many different factors. Until I started writing these articles and dissecting all of the components, there were influences that I was not even aware of. Let me help you with scenario analysis and let’s work on devising a game plan. Here is an example from earlier this week that I highlighted in the chat room. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Market Long-Term</h4>
<p>Everything starts with your long-term market outlook. It provides context for the current trading day. At this moment, SPY has been moving above and below the major moving averages frequently. The 100-day and the 200-day MAs are very close to each other (converging) and buyers and sellers are paired off. We know this because we are seeing big movements on heavy volume in both directions and the D1 candles are mixed. The SPY is right in the middle of its 60-day range and a it is neutral. The Fed will release its statement in two days and they are likely to be dovish. Recent bank failures have sparked credit concerns. This would be a shift from the Fed’s hawkish stance. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Market Short-Term</h4>
<p>This morning the market is going to gap up 35 S&amp;P 500 points. It will open above the major moving averages and this will be a new 5-day high. The FOMC meeting is tomorrow and the market is pricing in a “dovish” tone after the recent bank failures. 1OP is ending a bullish cycle and the volume is very light. The previous days have had movement both ways and one side has not been dominant.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Game Plan Scenario 1</h5>
<p>The market is gapping higher. This could be a “Gap and Go” and we are above all of the major moving averages. Only stacked green candles would prompt me to take early action. That would be a sign that buyers are aggressive. That move would only last an hour and then the market would compress in a tight range. If this unfolds, I will only trade half size. The move is largely exhausted after a big overnight move higher so a “Gap and Go” is less attractive than a “Gap Reversals”. This scenario is very unlikely. There was not any overnight news to fuel a move higher. The day before an FOMC statement we are not likely to see heavy volume and aggressive buying. This would be my least favorite scenario since I would have to take action early and since the upside is relatively limited after a big opening gap up. The downside risk is also higher because of a potential reversal. Imagine what the pattern I’ve just described might look like. The charts shown in each of the scenarios below are not real. I created them so that you can visualize each scenario.</p>

                    <div class="gallery w-100 d-md-flex mb-md-4 p-4">

                    </div>
                
<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Game Plan Scenario 2</h5>
<p>A wimpy drift higher on light volume with mixed overlapping candles would be our best scenario and it coincides with the completion of a 1OP bullish cycle. That type of price action tells me that sellers are present (If sellers were not present, we would see long green candles stacked. The mixed overlapping candles tell us they are keeping a lid on the rally). That sluggish move would give me time to find stocks with relative weakness. If it happens in the first 45 minutes of the day it could set up a “Gap Reversal”. Bullish speculators will be flushed out and we could quickly take out the low of the day. Once that momentum is established we will start to fill in some of the overnight gap. Buyers and sellers have been present the last few weeks and there is no reason to think that the sellers have vanished. This is a likely scenario and it is the one that has the greatest profit potential. The volume is likely to be low ahead of the Fed and a Gap Reversal will provide us with some momentum. I will short a bearish hammer off of the high of the day knowing a bearish 1OP cross is pending. I will add on a new low of the day. This could be the only decent market move of the day. If I see long red candles and the volume picks up I can add to the short positions. That would be a sign that we are going to test the 100-day MA and that more of the gap could fill. If more than half of the gap is preserved on this dip, it is not likely to gain traction. In that case I have to start scaling out as the bearish cycle completes or if I start to see support forming.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Game Plan Scenario 3</h5>
<p>The market opens with stacked red candles and decent volume. This would only happen if sellers are aggressive and if the volume is also heavy. They are so anxious to short that they smash every bid in sight. This would signal that most of the gap will fill and that a Gap Reversal is likely. Those often turn into bearish trend days and I can get aggressive with my shorts. Along the way I want to see the 100-day MA obliterated. As much as I would like to see this scenario, it is not likely. Traders are positioned for the FOMC and we are not likely to see aggressive buying or selling this close to the statement. If I get it, I will scale in quickly and I will keep adding on red candles if they stack consecutively. I will have a full position on early and then I will evaluate the price action around the 100-day MA.</p>

                    </div>
                
<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Game Plan Scenario 4</h5>
<p>The market has a choppy drift lower with mixed overlapping candles and light volume. This is a very likely scenario. Buyers and sellers have been active recently and this would be a sign that the early bounce is sparking profit taking by bulls. If half of the gap is preserved and I start to see support forming I have to take gains on shorts. These would be small starter positions and the lack of momentum would prevent me from adding. I will be in profit management mode and there might be a chance to trade from the long side. This scenario would demonstrate that the bid is fairly strong. The move lower was stubborn and more than half of the gap was preserved. </p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Game Plan Scenario 5</h5>
<p>The market compresses near the high of the day and the opening price is preserved during the bearish 1OP cycle. That scenario would tell me that the gap up on the open was legitimate. Profit takers and short sellers were not able to knock the market down. The temptation early on is to test the bid and to “goose” a reversal. That effort failed and the market was able to tread water during an entire bearish cycle. The gains have been “digested” and sellers will be less aggressive because they feel they will be able to sell at a higher price. Buyers will be emboldened and they will start raising their bids. A bullish 1OP cross in this scenario would lead to a new high of the day and the market will float higher on light volume. Sellers are present and that is why the market compressed. If they were not present, we would have seen stacked green candles and follow through buying after the initial gap up. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Executing the Game Plan</h4>
<p>At this stage we have the different scenarios mapped out. By the way, this comes with experience. What took me hours to write and demonstrate happens in minutes after the opening bell. So what is the priority? Scenario 1 (stacked green candles) and Scenario 3 (stacked red candles) are the only ones that would deserve early action. Since the market action has been two-sided and since there is no D1 up trend, I would not be very interested in Scenario 1. A “Gap and Go” presents higher risk and lower reward. It would force me to take a long position early and I am vulnerable to a reversal if the move quickly runs out of steam. Consequently, I am not going to spend time looking for longs right away. Scenario 3 is a “Gap Reversal”. That move would indicate heavy selling and it has a chance to gain momentum since there is plenty of room to drop as the gap fills. I can stick with these positions longer, they present greater profit potential and this pattern has a good chance of turning into a trend day. Consequently, the best use of my time is to look for stocks with relative weakness. Scenario 2 is a wimpy rally and Scenario 4 is a gradual drift lower. Those also set up well for shorts. Scenario 5 will take an hour to unfold since we need proof that the opening gap up is going to be preserved. If the short scenarios don’t materialize in the first hour, there will be plenty of time to shift gears and to look for longs. </p>
<p>The day has started and we start looking for weak stocks. We need D1 breakdowns through technical support (trendlines, major SMAs or horizontal support). We want to see these levels breached with long red candles and heavy volume. We would also like to see relative weakness on a D1 basis.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Outcome</h4>
<p>The market was able to hold the opening bid for about 30 minutes and it compressed at the high of the day. 1OP was spiking and that was a sign of a potential reversal. The market had not been able to advance while the bullish cycle was completing. There was an attempt to breakout to a new high of the day, but that long green candle turned into a bearish hammer by the time it finished. Bullish speculators rushed in and they were going to have the door slammed in their face. The next bar took out the low of the day and it was time to short. At this stage it was too early to tell if the selling would gain momentum, but now that we are in the gap, we have plenty of room to the downside and we have a fresh 1OP bearish cycle to work with. On any additional weakness in the SPY and the stock, the plan was to add. Note that buyers did initially support the gap. On a Gap Reversal, the selling pressure would reveal itself immediately and the first few candles would be long and red and the volume would be heavy. We did not see that. Instead, the volume on the drop was light and the candle bodies were small. This told us to temper our bearishness. Add once, expect follow through and manage the gains. The market drifted lower, but a decent sized bounce happened well before half of the gap was filled. That was a sign of support. The market did make a new low of the day, but it was a marginal new low (barely got below the previous LOD). That was another sign of support. This was a sign to take gains on shorts that found support. The candle bodies remained tiny, the volume was light and 1OP was flat-lining around zero. The middle of the day was a time to lay low.</p>

<p>During the first 30 minutes of trading, Digital Realty Trust (DLR) was coming up in the bearish searches. It had all of the characteristics we look for and it was highlighted in the chat room. It had broken a Low+ trendline, and horizontal support on a long red D1 candle. It was below all of the major MAs, it was relatively weak and the volume was heavy. It was an excellent candidate. </p>

<p>When the SPY made a new low of the day, DLR also made a new low of the day. In fact, when the SPY was treading water, the stock was ticking lower and that was a sign of relative weakness. This is worthy of a starter short position. The SPY volume was still light so it was important to wait for follow through. When the SPY continued to drift lower and the stock had a red Key Bar, the weakness was confirmed and this warranted adding to the position. The SPY price action was not extremely bearish so there would not be a reason to short aggressively. As it turned out, the SPY did bounce early and the next drop was a marginal new low. Support was starting to form. Fortunately, DLR was very weak and it continued to slip. There was no reason to exit the trade until it found relative strength later in the day. At that point, the market had also shown signs of strength. </p>

<p>Game planning is very important for day trading because some of the biggest moves happen early in the day. You have to know what might unfold and what your actions will be. As the day progresses, the price action becomes clear and we have a better sense of what might happen in the last few hours of the day. There is no urgency because we have had time to look for longs and shorts. On this particular day, the SPY made a higher low double bottom late in the day (Please reference the SPY 2 charts earlier). It rallied above the VWAP and there was a bullish 1OP cross. This was a good entry point for longs and I posted this chart of GOOG in the chat room. </p>

<p>GOOG had been strong all day and you could have owned it at any point during the day and done well. The price action was very tight and the volume was heavy. The stock preserved its relative strength until late in the day. It pulled back slightly, but there was no reason to believe that the buyers who had been supporting the stock all day were going to abandon it when the market was showing signs of strength. Once the stock regained its relative strength it made it back to the high of the day. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Once you do all of your analysis, you can draw conclusions and conduct scenario analysis. Some outcomes will be more likely, some will present greater profit potential and some will be less attractive (higher risk). Based on each of these scenarios you can develop a game plan. Try to visualize it. The game plan will include your position size, the conditions that would prompt you to add, the target position size if all goes as expected, when to exit the trade and how you will know if the position needs to be stopped out. This all sounds very complicated, but it’s not. It happens naturally for experienced traders in a matter of minutes. They can look at a trade, go through the mental checklist and know how they are going to proceed. They have a keen sense of awareness. It does take time and repetition to develop this skill.</p>
<p>The advantage to game planning is staying one step ahead. Wayne Gretzky was asked, “What makes you so great?” He replied, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.” Game planning will help you achieve that. </p>
