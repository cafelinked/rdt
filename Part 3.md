                <div>Sorry for the length of the post….Hey All – I’m new here, second day on the chat and just lurking and trying not to ask any dumb questions. But since it is after hours, figure I would ask for a small bit of advice and hoping it doesn’t break chat rules. I’m having success, for the most part, picking RS and RW stocks but having a bit of a difficult time pinpointing when to choose long or short around 30-45min into trading. For example, I picked 2 shorts today at 10am and they flat lined (to down just a bit) for almost the entire day (great RW against SPY) but of course gave way later in the day and went up (I scratched at least). Are you guys picking a supply/demand/support/resistance area for SPY and waiting until it reacts to that level and then deciding on direction?</div>

                <div>Quick note on trading reversals and continuations. If you have a stock with a strong D1 chart in an uptrend and you are buying an M5 dip, that is not a reversal trade, that is a continuation trade. Just because the M5 chart might have been temporarily weak, buying that dip is not considered trading reversals. You are trying to get on the longer term trend.&nbsp;</div>

                </div>
                <div>If you are entering a trade as a day trade, you should keep it as such especially when the D1 is weak. I do NOT encourage this type of trading for most of you because you have to be very nimble and you have to set passive targets. Unfortunately, most novice traders buy those bounces thinking that they have just scooped the deal of the century and then the next leg lower crushes them. I addressed this in the video.&nbsp;</div>

If you have an incredible urge to buy, look at 1OP M5 SPY. If it is getting ready for a bearish cycle, hold off, That time will yield important information, you are likely to at very least see a red bar or two and you can gauge how well the stock help up.

                <div>But Pete, you told us to wait before we entered trades. Shouldn’t I wait to see what happens on SPY bearish cycle? Yes, that would be prudent, but I have been waiting already for the TSLA and SPY bullish cycles to run. I feel that if I wait for SPY to soften TSLA will drop. It is a small position so I don’t mind being a little early. If SPY rallies, TSLA is not likely to move higher (it has not moved higher in last 20 min during rally) and I will be able to exit for a small loss.</div>

                <div>so the SPY had a green candle two bars ago and most of it held. TSLA had a green candle as well, but it has given back those gains. Those are the clues you have to pick up on.

                <div>For any of you looking for day trades, you really want D1 strength. If you are wrong on the market or if you are wrong on the stock you have a tailwind and you can take some heat on a dip. I am not saying to let the bottom of the stock drop out, but you do have longer term strength working in your favor. When you try to bottom fish and play bounces off of a D1 thrashing you are just asking for trouble. Those moves are profit taking by shorts and when the sellers return the rug will get pulled out from under you. YOU HAVE NO STAYING POWER. I cover this in all of my videos, but it takes some people longer to grasp the concept</div>

<div>This my fav. D1 in compression .. if you can find a compression on multiple time frames even better. My favorite is a 195 min compression, when those fire they make for great intraday or 1/2 day swings.&nbsp;<b>@Izzy_G</b><p></p>

<div>Again the key is the entry. You need to make sure that long red candle that broke through the lod on CVNA was legit. Even more so the case when 1OP M5 SPY is screaming higher and 1OP CVNA M5 is also moving higher at 10:40. CVNA had a bearish cross at 11:05. I like the entry better at 11:35. then you have bearish cycle M5 CVNA and SPY and 1OSI &lt; 1

                <p>Looking at the daily chart, yes it was a good candidate for shorting (for me at least.. maybe I’m wrong) Noting that anything goes down may come up, I leaned on the M5 price action and thought that the bid was found resulting stock move higher. If I’ve held it for sure would make money. If held it and the stock kept going up, for sure would have a bigger damage that would be harder to recover. Any advise about how to identify bail time vs lean on the daily chart and embrace the bigger losses time will be appreciated. On the other hand though leaning on the daily is great there is a possibility of having a big reversal like today on the same stock that’s been dumping for a while..</p>

                </div>
                <div>So on that red bar that you shorted at a new lod, hold off for one bar. The next bar you want to see a red bar. Then you can short. You might miss a little of the move, but it will also prevent you from a short covering rally. by waiting you would have seen a green bar that retraced half of the red bar. Then you wait longer and see the stock advancing. Now you have a small upward sloping trendline to guide you on the short. Up trendline breached, stock &lt; EMA (8), 1OSI &lt; 0... bang short it. This is the exact same lesson I taught at the lod on SPY today. Those new lod will lure in shorts and the programs can squeeze you. Your problem was not with your exit, it was with your entry. Wait one more bar</div>

                <p><b>@Izzy_G</b>&nbsp;Here is my lesson on hedging. If you feel the need to hedge, reduce your positions and size. Sell farther out of the money to give yourself more cushion. Hedges often do not perform correctly. Instead of having a hedged basket of crap I prefer to be liquid during periods of elevated risk so that I can focus on opportunity and not my basket of crap and how my hedges are performing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <div>FYI. on these light days you should be trading stock and not options. The options bid/ask spread is too wide to overcome when the market is not moving and you need to be able to get in and out with ease. You want to be flat before the FOMC. If you are trading options you might just get to the point where the position is profitable and the bullish/bearish cycle ends. Then the market moves against you and you are back to square one. With a stock you will be able to take gains on the trade because the bid/ask is tight and you can buy bids and sell offers on the stock. You can’t do that with options. If you think you are selling an ask in options, you really aren’t. The stock has simply move sufficiently to where the mkt mkrs are willing to take you out. You get filled at your price (ask) and then that price often becomes the bid</div>

                <div>In that PFE example I posted earlier you would have been waiting to see what 1OP did and in that time the stock did dip and you would have had a better entry point. You would have seen that the profit taking was minimal and that the stock instantly found support. That was a bullish flag and entering on that dip gave you another support level you could lean on for support. Sometimes a bearish 1OP will lead to a big market drop and you will be happy you waited.

<div>We have often used VXX hedges in this room – I am using them now because I feel if there is going to be downside it would not be a “gradual” dip, but rather a more violent reversal which would make my VXX calls far more profitable than SPY puts.<p></p>

                <div>Since it is interesting discussion (hedging) – At the beginning of the month – SPY dropped roughly 3 percent over the period of one week, and during that time the VXX went up 42.8% – Thus, if I am looking to protect several positions against the possibility of a reversal, which is the only thing I am hedging against here – VXX offers one the best possible coverage.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hedging by definition is not something that requires confirmation btw, if you have confirmation – it is not a hedge, it is regular trade.&nbsp; For example, if one has $5000 in bullish positions – let’s say $2,500 in AAPL calls (5 calls for $5 each), and $2,500 in TSLA calls (2 calls for $12.50 each) – each of those calls having a delta of .65.&nbsp; Now if SPY drops 1% (roughly $4.60) which has happened several times this month, it is entirely probable that the value of those calls will be cut in half.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now let’s say you spent 10% of your bullish investment on VXX calls ($500), getting you 4 ITM calls for 12/23.&nbsp; A 1% drop in SPY historically translates to about a 10% increase in VXX -that 10% increase turns the $500 hedge into roughly $1,500 – which cover 60% of your loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;However if that drop in SPY doesn’t occur, VXX is now at a low point, and even with SPY rising the drop in VXX slows to a crawl roughly around $20, meaning my potential loss in the VXX in also minimal (approx 20% loss in value).&nbsp; &nbsp;So I have a hedge that covers me pretty much 6 to 1 which minimal downside.</div>

<div>I very much agree with you @Pete and so should many here in the chat. To demonstrate further on your point,&nbsp;<span class="caps">UVXY </span>– the leveraged&nbsp;<span class="caps">VXX </span>short term futures etf – if this etf has lined up with 1Op 1OSI and 1OMO then you have a <b><i>very powerful signal indeed</i></b>, that should <i>never be ignored</i>. When I get this line up, I’m given the green flag confirmation to go <b><i>heavy</i></b>&nbsp;futures/index/leveraged etf or stay long/short with confidence perhaps even overnight. When it does <b>NOT </b>line up, I ignore its meaning entirely for the reasons you’ve articulated. On Fed days, like today, I don’t apply that much attention to this whether it lines up or not. Today is a reactionary day – an outlier of sorts – and should be ignored.&nbsp; The best hedge is to reduce risk or take a position in stocks that have rel weakness. I do not like hedging with VXX as well.</div>

                <div>Hedging is a personal preference and there are many vehicles and methods that can be used. I never said VXX/VIX was ineffective. Yes I have used it in the past and I will use it in the future. Is it my favorite way to hedge? No and I stated why. I prefer to short stocks that are rel weak because I have an edge there. I also prefer to reduce my risk by carrying fewer positions or by selling farther OTM spreads when risk is elevated. You might choose to have a larger basket of long positions and to hedge it with other instruments. If you want to buy SPY puts or VXX/VIX, great that will work as well. I also short futures during the day when there is market weakness and that acts as a natural hedge. Do what suits you. Experiment with a variety of methods and determine the one that works for you.</div>

                <div>Wow what a rally…. Question – Instead of straight puts/calls that are 1-2 weeks out, why not just do a CDS/PDS 1-2 weeks out for the same amount so that you could cap theta losses? In other words, say instead of getting 1 call for $8 you get 2 CDS contracts for $4 each. In my mind its the same amount of upside but less downside bec it helps theta decay if stock goes against you for a few days or a week. One hole i can poke in this is that it might be harder to close the position bec of the bid/ask spread but is there anything else im missing or getting wrong?&nbsp;</div>

<div>No i mean i know we do them here, but its always for same week exp. My questions more along the lines of why EVER do anything else besides a spread. Im wondering if theres a simple, obvious, or just a valid reason why doing straight calls/puts are superior that im overlooking&nbsp;<p></p>

                <div>You only gain confidence by using it. I can draw a thousand charts and explain it 5X a day. trade 1 MES contract and try it out. Each S&amp;P point is $5. If you fell asleep at the wheel and you were short after the Fed a 50 pt rally would have lost $250. I do not advocate trading S&amp;P to new traders, but if you are hell bent to try, I can’t stop you</div>

When they understand the market well and can get to a 70%+ win rate on stocks? Just curious because trading Futures sounds tempting but I know I am not ready yet and don’t want to risk it.</p>

                <div>Thank you, sir. So when purchasing options, when do you know to purchase an option that is slightly OTM (such as a lotto for example), and something like what happened with ABT? I guess I am confusing the time value decay with the risk of the trade.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>if you take an out of the money call regardless of how confident you are the stock will go in the money (guess what many times we are wrong and they dont)&nbsp; the entire price you paid for the option is made up of time decay and implied volatility no intrinsic value so if the stock pulls back you options get hit much harder than the in the money ones since they still had some value beyond time decay and volatility. Believe me i have been in the mindset where buying cheap out of the money calls looked like asure thing. It isn’t and buying out of the money calls (or puts) is a losing strategy over time</div>

                <p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS FRIDAY – The market is near the all-time high and gains will be hard fought from now until year end. Momentum and seasonal strength are keeping buyers engaged, but the FOMC meeting next week will temper the urge to buy near the all-time high. </p>
<div>For more extensive commentary, please read my comments from Thursday. </div>
<div>A hot CPI this morning (.8%) sparked a positive market reaction. How is this possible? Higher inflation should lead to higher interest rates and higher interest rates should be bad for stocks – right? That is true during the initial stages of Fed tightening, but there are a few forces in play that are trumping that headline news. Yesterday I mentioned corporate buy backs and they are happening at a record pace ahead of tax changes. Today is the last day for that surge according to Bank of America. There could have also been pent up buying and those traders were going to wait for the reaction to the CPI. As inflation rises it drives real returns on bonds (yield minus inflation rate) further into negative territory and that makes stocks more attractive on a relative basis. There is also the notion that the Fed might accelerate tapering, but they will not tighten. </div>
<div>I am sure the talking heads on CNBC will find even more excuses to justify the rally. The bullish reaction does not make sense to me so my explanation is simple. There is a ton of cash looking for a home. Even at extreme valuations, stocks are still the “best game in town”. There are also fewer shares due to stock buybacks and we are competing with corporations to buy those stocks. </div>
<div>The next FOMC meeting is on December 15th and it is an important one. We can expect tapering and that could cause some nervous jitters before the release. The Fed does NOT want to tighten, but they have removed the phrase “transitory inflation” from their statements. They have admitted that inflation is stronger than they expected and that the pace of tapering will be accelerated. Inflation will force their hand. </div>
<div>Swing traders should manage their out of the money bullish put spreads. Your opportunity was last week when the market tested support at the 50-day MA. At this stage I would not be adding to your long exposure. </div>
<div>Day traders should not chase the open today. There is a chance for a gap and go, but there is no way I will buy a gap higher this close to the all-time high. If we have a compression or a dip I will be looking for stocks with relative strength. If I see red candles stacked consecutively with little to no overlap I will short (gap reversal). I don’t care about the CPI or the reaction; I am just going to watch price movement. I have seen two-sided price action so I am ready to trade in either direction. Stay flexible. </div>
<div>Support is at $468 and resistance is at the all-time high. </div>

                <div>This is why we do not buy gaps up to the all time high or a major resistance level. Take a deep breath and wait for the price action. You know from my comments I was NOT going to chase a gap and go, but I sure as heck would short a gap reversal. You did not have to follow that short. Long only traders should have waited for support. Bullish 1OP cross and lots of tails under body were your clues to start buying. In all of this commotion, you have to find the best stocks quickly.

                <div>Gee Pete, I bought MSFT and I am getting nervous. Shouldn’t I be stopping the trade out? That depends. Was your market forecast wrong? Do you now think that the market is going to fill the gap and go lower? Did MSFT lose its rel str? Why is MSFT down? The answer is, MSFT is holding up well. The only reason it is down is the market.&nbsp; The market is likely to fill in the gap and once support is established msft will rebound. If the market starts stacking red candles after filling the gap I will have to take some of my position off because I was wrong about the market. The jerky price action today tells me that there is support and that we are not going to see a free fall today</div>

                <div>So 1OP has not been able to go &gt; 0. Until it does, we should expect the current trend to remain intact. The bounces have been brief. You will notice that the lod was a marginal new low so we should find some support near the low from Thurs. If the lod from Thurs fails (20% chance) we will continue to drift lower and that has to happen in the next hour. If we find support at lod then there will be a bottoming process that will last a few hours with multiple tests. The volatility is also likely to decline. Asset Mgrs are going to be relatively passive at the all-time high with a hot CPI ahead of the FOMC&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@Andreas</b>&nbsp;to be honest, I don’t look at RS/RW on a pre-market basis – the market dynamics are so different pre-market that most of that changes dramatically once the bell rings.&nbsp; Instead I look at what sectors are hot, which ones are cold, what stocks are strong without a catalyst (i.e. if MSFT is up big pre-market but there is no news behind it), I look at the volume on certain stocks and pre-market highs, but I put much more stock in the immediate price-action during the day.</p>

                <div>Overall though, I am looking at the market as a whole, what is it doing, and I find even then it tends to be meaningful in the extremes, but not in the middle-ground.&nbsp; So if S&amp;P Futures is down -60, I can be pretty sure we are in for a bearish day, but even then it is more determined by the actual price action after the open.&nbsp; So basically I look at Pre and AH as a matter of interest/curiosity but not much else – however, that is just me.</div>

                <p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS THURSDAY – The market is near the all-time high and gains will be hard fought from now until year end. Momentum and seasonal strength are keeping buyers engaged, but the FOMC meeting next week will temper the urge to buy near the all-time high. </p>
<div>The big market rally Tuesday should have produced follow through yesterday and it did not. A daily chart reveals that when the downward sloping trend line has been breached to the upside after a major support level has been tested, we have seen heavy follow through buying and the market makes a new all-time high. This has been a reliable pattern in the last year and the lack of follow through this week would be a sign that resistance is building. </div>
<div>Earnings season was excellent, but valuations are at 20-year highs. Real bond yields (interest rate less inflation) are falling farther into negative territory and that makes stocks attractive on a relative basis. The system is flush with cash and Asset Managers, retail investors and corporations (in the form of share buy backs) are using that cash to buy stocks. The last point is particularly interesting right now. In the last 5 years AAPL has repurchased 25% of its shares outstanding. </div>
<div>Bank of America reported that its corporate clients bought back twice as many shares last week ($3.4B) as they did the week before and that is the highest level since March. They also reported that corporate buybacks accounted for half of the volume for all customers last week. This is why the market bid has remained so strong. The Fed is keeping interest rates artificially low so corporations issue cheap debt and they use the proceeds to buy back shares. Investors are forced to buy equities because bond yields don’t keep pace with inflation (negative real returns). There are fewer shares available and demand is increasing demand so the price goes up. Corporations are aggressively buying back shares ahead of tax reforms and that window will close December 10th for regulatory reasons according to Bank of America. </div>
<div>The next FOMC meeting is on December 15th and it is an important one. We can expect tapering and that could cause some nervous jitters before the release. The Fed does NOT want to tighten, but they have removed the phrase “transitory inflation” from their statements. They have admitted that inflation is stronger than they expected and that the pace of tapering will be accelerated. Inflation will force their hand. Tomorrow the CPI will be released and a “hot” number could make investors nervous heading into the Fed meeting next week. </div>
<div>Swing traders should manage their out of the money bullish put spreads. Your already opportunity was last week when the market tested support at the 50-day MA. At this stage I would not be adding to your long exposure. </div>
<div>Day traders should watch for stacked green candles near the open. Down opens in an upward trending market is my favorite set-up. If the candles are mixed, be patient and use that time to find stocks with technical breakouts on heavy volume and watch for relative strength. When market support has been confirmed, buy these stocks. I believe that corporate buy backs will provide a strong bid through the week. The market held all of the gains from Tuesday and I believe we have another leg higher that will end Friday. That does NOT mean you should take a lot of overnight longs. The CPI due out Friday could be a speedbump. Any dip Friday will present a better entry point to get long and there is no reason to take that risk ahead of an inflation number. The range yesterday was a third of the normal range. If the candles are mixed and we stay in the first hour range, reduce your size and trade count. </div>
<div>Support is at the low from Tuesday and resistance is at the high from Tuesday. </div>

<div>Quick question – let’s say the market turns right now and DIS drops, going red…..is that a stock you feel you can hold overnight?&nbsp; or will you have no choice but to take the loss?&nbsp; Are there better uses of your money? Better stocks to go long?&nbsp; Or are you simply thinking – “Disney dropped a lot recently, and there is a lot of room for it to go up here.”<p></p>

                <div>OPTIONS TACTIC: I like to buy deep ITM options. On many of these stocks (TSLA, GOOG, AMZN) the bid ask is a mile wide. When I get a long red candle (i.e. NVDA) and I want to short, I look at the bid/ask and I place a buy order for the puts below the current bid. The stock typically rallies on the next bar into that red candle and I am filled. Then by the time the candle completes we are back down to the close of the red candle. Just a tip.</div>

If you are entering a trade you can use that retracement for entry. Problem is you do not know how far the candle will retrace and those moves do NOT last long. You must have an order working. If not, you will be chasing your tail and trying to hit a moving target</div>

<div>@pete this is a stupid question but here goes. While we are waiting for the market to show a direction we are looking for stocks with RS/RW. When the market does start to make a move are you buying that stock only after it breaks out, or would you be willing to buy it off support earlier?&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>I want to see support other than just 1OP getting ready to cross. Long tails under body, mixed green and red candles, bullish hammer, bullish engulf, tiny little candles – on SPY of course. All of these suggest support. If I see that and deep 1OP cross, sure I will cheat sometimes and start scaling in. If that SPY coincides with longer term support (prior day low) I will be a bit more aggressive<p></p>

<div>The premise for my FB trade was the breach above the 100-day MA. That is why I felt FB would go higher. If I was leaning on the 100-day MA in the first place, why would I get out of the trade when it is still intact? Notice, I was not getting the warm fuzzies I needed so I did exit half of the position earlier and I posted exactly why in the chat room.&nbsp;<p></p>

<div>Don’t focus on the trades posted, look at the charts and find the common elements. We talk about them constantly, but many people are visual. Once you understand the pattern, rely on the chat room less. I don’t want any noise or distractions when I trade.

                <div>What this feels like – to be honest, are <i>followed trades</i>.&nbsp; And here is the problem, position sizing to your account.&nbsp; For example, let’s just say I have $500,000 in an account – so I buy 2,000 shares of HPW at around $37.50.&nbsp; That is $75,000.&nbsp; But I would have $2 million in Day Trading Buying Power – so that HPQ position is taking up 3.75% of my account.&nbsp; Do you think if that were the case I would be staring at the chart all the time and wondering about it? No – it is properly sized, it hasn’t broken technical support, and if it takes a week to get profitable with it, it takes a week.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now if you had a 10,000 account, with 20,000 in buying power (2X until PDT), the equivalent trade would be to <b>20 shares</b>&nbsp;of HPQ.&nbsp; If you had <b>20 shares </b>you would have no issue holding it until it either went into profit or broke technical support.&nbsp; And that is also why I bought <i style="font-weight: bold;">shares</i>&nbsp;of it and not options, because the stock can be a slow mover, and I felt it might need time if it got into trouble.</div>

                <p><b>@Abie</b>&nbsp;When you take bullish swing trades they are driven by your confidence in the market. I spent most of my eBook explaining that. If I am super confident I might be buying calls in size. If I am less confident and mildly bullish I am selling OTM bullish put spreads – sparingly. Right now I am mildly bullish and I voice that in my posts each morning. I see some warning signs and I think the market could take a giant crap so I keep my swings to a min. That does not mean Hari feels the same way. He could be so bullish that he had horns popping out of his chest. If that is the case, he is not fearful of a market drop, he is embracing it because he can buy more. YOU MARKET CONFIDENCE IS WHAT MATTERS. If you are scared like I am – don’t do any bullish swing trades. You have no staying power so someone not bailing on trades that you are getting hammered on seems reckless.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@rrathk1</b>&nbsp;For HPQ swing you would identify how far you are willing to let it drop. Does the gap up from earnings have to hold? Does the up trend line have to hold? Does the open from the last long red candle have to hold? What is your stop out point. You also need to consider the market. Hey, Pete said this SPY pattern usually has some follow thru so I am going to buy a strong stock on that notion. Oh, oh, Pete did not see any follow thru in SPY and he did not take any overnights Wed. That would be a sign that your market forecast was wrong. If you market forecast is that the CPI reaction will be benign and that any market drop before the FOMC is a buy, you are not going to worry about it. Just as I said to Able your market opinion and confidence in that opinion (not mine, not DaveW, not Hari’s) drive your trading decisions. You have to be able to identify when you were wrong on the market and/or wrong on the stock</p>

Stocks with rel str will do the heavy lifting and if the market does rally, you will have that tailwind working with you. If 1OP spikes and crests with market at hod, prudent to take gains on some of the longs. That is how we trade</div>

                <div>Here’s why I hate these days. 365 days minus weekends = 260 days. There are 9 exchange holidays and you can easily take out an additional 2 days for those (1 before and one after). That leaves 240. You have 8 FOMC meetings and you can take out Tues and Wed for those. Now you have 224 trading days. If you take out 24 low volume days in late July, most of Aug and the last two weeks of the year you are left with 200 trading days – at most. Each one of these lack luster days takes away from that total. There are probably 50 excellent trading days a year and 100 that are good. Then there are about 50 that are really tough like this. Very important to know which are the really good days because that is when you need to strike.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>So AAPL has been red hot today. It has everyone’s attention. There were shorts at the high of the day and there were multiple touches. If programs could just “goose” the stock thru the hod they would force short covering. That short covering would also attract lots of bullish specs playing the breakout. There could have been some recycled new that hit the wire. Once the bullish specs rushed in and bought and once the shorts had covered, the program quickly reversed a slammed the door on them.</div>

<div>Any advice on this would be great. My biggest issue lately is when I have several stocks I’m watching all make a positive move that would check all my boxes to enter the trade. At that point I hesitate and continue flipping the charts to find which of the few is the best play. After wasting another several minutes, I either get a poor entry or never enter any of the trades and watch them blow by. Any advice at all would help, or if there is one indication that holds more weight than the others for you?</div>

<div>The key there is the word “hesitate” – and if you are flipping through that many at once, it would be off a search you ran – not that those are bad, you should be running those, but during the heat of battle (i.e. during trading hours) you should be looking at stocks that are coming up on scanners and from alerts, which means you should be getting them spaced out during the day.&nbsp; If you run a search and see a lot of good stocks, look at them first as potential swing candidates.<p></p>

                <div>There is a lot of mention about how a stock has RS, then loses it, than has it again, etc.&nbsp; Think of it this way – 1)Look at the daily chart of the stock, <i>overall</i>&nbsp;how is it performing compared to the market?&nbsp; So let’s zoom out a bit – over the last 10 days <b>SPY</b>&nbsp;has gone – <i>nowhere</i>. It is pretty much the same price it was 10 trading days ago.&nbsp; <b>But</b>&nbsp;over the four days <b>SPY</b>&nbsp;has gone up 4.6%.&nbsp; Now let’s look at <b>AAPL</b>, compared to the last 10 days <b>AAPL</b>&nbsp;has gone up 9.8%, compared to <b>SPY</b>&nbsp;going up 0%.&nbsp; So that is a <b>huge amount of Relative Strength.</b>&nbsp; Ok, how about the last four days?&nbsp; <b>AAPL</b>&nbsp;went up 9.7% ($159.72 on 12/3 and $175.25 today) compared to<b>&nbsp;SPY</b>&nbsp;which went up 4.6%, which means <b>AAPL</b>&nbsp;went up 210% more than <b>SPY – </b>once again – <i>Relative Strength.&nbsp; </i>So now you know you have a stock that is stronger than the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s look at today – <b>AAPL</b>&nbsp;is up 4% (3.99) and <b>SPY </b>is up .25%, which is a 16X advantage to <b>AAPL</b>&nbsp;– once again AAPL is strong.&nbsp; Finally, look at the 5 min chart, and it is telling you that AAPL had a lot of RS in the beginning of the day, and then it chopped around, the price didn’t move much and neither did SPY’s, meaning there was no real RS – but overall, does AAPL have strength against this market right now, hell yeah it does.</div>

                <div>Think of a group of runner, let’s say 100 runners all lined up for a race – those runners are stocks.&nbsp; Now imagine there is a 150mph wind going right into the runners faces – so they need to run into the wind – the wind is SPY.&nbsp; So for this analogy, SPY opens down (150 mph winds into the runners) and the race starts.&nbsp; Right away 70 of the runners fall way back, they are getting manhandled by the wind, 20 of them manage to stay in place fighting the wind but holding their ground, 5 of them stagger forward gaining some distance from the other runners but not much, and then 5 of them are running into the wind as if it isn’t there.&nbsp; Those 5 runners are your 5% of stocks that are just surging upwards even though SPY is down.&nbsp; Now imagine the wind changes direction (i.e. SPY reverses or bounces) and it is now at the backs of the runners – who do you think wins this race? The runners that got knocked backwards? No, maybe they can get off their ass and start moving forward again, but they aren’t catching up.&nbsp; Obviously the front runners will have the advantage – <i>but</i>&nbsp;sometimes those runners will get tired, I mean they just spent half the race running <i>into </i>the wind, so they might take a breather and just let the wind push them and maybe the runner that were able to stagger forward earlier get a bigger boost.&nbsp; But overall you know who the best runners are – even if they take a break, even if they get tired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@Zippy</b>&nbsp;Learning S&amp;P 500 price movements is important to trading, however, if you are going to trade one product is should NOT be SPY/ES. There is no edge to trading it. Why play against the largest institutions in the world? Find a very liquid stock that has relative strength to the SPY and trade it as a surrogate market position. This is the basis of what I preach and I strongly disagree that if you are going to trade one instrument it should be SPY/ES</p>

                <div>With regards to picking one stock to focus on, I would take it one step farther and say that you should not limit yourself to stocks that have liquid options. You are limiting yourself and there could be fantastic stocks with incredible D1 breakouts and heavy volume with M5 relative strength that are great for learning. LRCX and AVGO are two examples from yesterday. The key is to have your market bias and not to be blindsided by it, but to find the fastest horse to ride. One that is nice and orderly and that will not throw you.</div>

                <div>I get this question daily. “Pete, what is the best search?” or “Pete what is the search I should use on the open?” I really hate answering these questions because I know the trader is looking for a silver bullet solution. If I had one best search, why the hell would I publish more than a dozen bullish searches? I wouldn’t. My response is to learn the system I teach. I’ve spent 30 years refining this system. This is not something you are going to come in and master in a few weeks. With a tiny bit of due diligence (relative to the time and learning curve I had to go through) you can read the manual and understand the searches and which ones to use under which market conditions. When you get more proficient at the system you can roll up your sleeves and think about what each Custom Search variable represents. Think about what you are trying to find and then combine the variables in such a fashion that you will be able to search for the pattern you are looking for.&nbsp; If you can’t crack a book, read a manual or keep logs, I really have no interest in talking to you. Been there done that, don’t waste my time. You will not be here long.</div>

                <div>Hari’s biggest gift to me was that he taught me through example that all things are possible in the market. Our fears are founded on past losses and pain tell us “cut it here, it could go to 0”. but the uncertainty of the markets is the freedom of the markets and can just as possibly send your trade to the moon. You wouldnt suddenly think that a coin toss, after 9 tosses against you, will be increasing your probabilities of a 10th loss in a row. We only do that as humans in markets because our past fears are wired into us. Mark Douglas Tom Hougaard are all about this, and Hari Moo Richard Dave Pete show us this in reality every day.&nbsp;my final contribution for the day, blessed family beach time (my speedos ready Hari) is calling. good trading to all!&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

                <div>The other pattern is a bullish 1OP cross that does not move higher (like the one we are on now). There will be a series of tiny consecutive red candles. They will challenge the low end of the compression and they will break it. This move would have to start soon. The key is follow thru and we need to distance ourselves from the hod. Once that move gains traction the selling pressure will build. If this scenario unfolds it will provide a nice entry for overnight longs.&nbsp;</div>

<div>A long long time ago, I took a $10K account to over $25K using nothing but /ES.&nbsp; Started with 6 /MES contracts each, worked it up until it could be a regular /ES, and then took it to over $25K.&nbsp; Trading nothing but /ES, no other trades.&nbsp; That was interesting.&nbsp; Took 3 1/2 weeks.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>I’ve taken a strong interest in trading /ES mostly due to the high margin available and smaller account requirements. Why did you decide to start trading stocks also with so much success in /ES? You would be able to keep increasing position size with that kind of consistency right?</div>
</div>

<div>Off the bat why should I restrict myself to just trading “one thing”, also while the 1OP gives an edge on SPY, the combination of having an edge on SPY and using Relative Strength together is extremely powerful.&nbsp; Finally, if I am long a stock with really good RS and SPY drops, that stock is going to hold the value, but if I was just long SPY I would be in a losing position.&nbsp;<p></p>

<div>Yes! Listen to Dave please – I know I am putting up winning futures trades and the whole “streak” thing – but, and I don’t know how else to say this – <i>this shit is hard. </i>Trading futures is harder than trading stocks, harder than options, and it can <i>wipe you out</i>.&nbsp; Please, do not just jump in and trade them.&nbsp; I am really really good – and I am not saying that to pay myself on the back, I know I am good, I am saying that because it takes a <i>long long time</i>&nbsp;to get this good.&nbsp; You are going to get hurt and badly if you try to play futures without the experience.<p></p>

                <p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS MONDAY – Bull markets die hard and this one is showing signs of strain. If you look at a weekly chart of the S&amp;P 500 you will notice two consecutive red bars. Take a look at the last 20 months and you can see that this is rare. Of greater importance is the fact that seasonal strength has not been able to offset the selling pressure. </p>
<div>Last week’s jobs report was dismal and the spread of the Omnicron variant could lead to further economic contraction as states impose new rules. Goldman Sachs lowered its GDP forecast because of it. The Fed is concerned about inflation and we know that from Powell’s testimony before Congress last week. He said that tapering is likely to happen much faster than expected pace. </div>
<div>Stock valuations have not been this rich since the tech bubble of 2000. Perfection is priced in and the back drop is NOT perfect. </div>
<div>China’s economic activity is contracting and its market is in bear territory (20% off of the high). Evergrande is inching closer to default and real estate developers are reporting tight credit conditions (a number of them are also on the ropes). Credit issues in the second largest economy in the world could cast a very wide shadow on all markets. China has been the global growth engine for the last two decades and I sense a great deal of “froth”. </div>
<div>Swing traders should be keeping long risk exposure to a minimum. At most, have a few nice bullish put spreads on. I would not add to bullish put spreads until support is established and retested. You may need to close those spreads down if the SPY does not find support at $452. If the market finishes below that support and the stock loses its relative strength and it is breaching support, close down the spread. Legging out is viable, but it requires the perfect set-up and I have a video on how to do it in Tutorials. If the market does not finish the year near the all-time high it will be a bearish omen for 2022. Time decay will be working in your favor and the stocks need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The bottom line is to keep your overnight risk exposure very low. I do not like what I see. </div>
<div>Day traders should watch for a gap reversal today. Asian markets were weak and tech stocks have been sluggish this morning. I do NOT believe we will see a sustained rally this morning until the downside has been tested. I still prefer to trade futures on the short side and to trade stocks on the long side. This has been a tough market for swing traders, but an excellent market for day traders. Pick your entry points carefully and expect two-sided action. </div>
<div>Support is at the low from Friday and resistance is the high from Friday. This will likely be an “inside day”. If the volume is light and the candles are mixed in the first hour we can expect a boring day. </div>

                <div>Problem with buying weak stocks that are bouncing is that the sellers can return in and instant. We have seen COIN and others during a market rally this AM. That nice bounce could fail quickly when SPY reverses. You have to navigate super wide options bid/asks and what looks great one minute is crap the next and you can’t get out because the bid/ask is a mile wide. That is why it is best to day trade the stock on some of these day trade bouncers, not options&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Trading is not always about the trades you caught, it is just as much about the traps you avoided.

                <div>when should we short SPY Pete? I am not going to. This is choppy action. No need to. For me I wanted to see more selling out of this bearish cycle. If the next bullish cycle does not get thru hod I will consider shorting.</div>

<div>@Andreas that’s a good point. &nbsp;@Pete or any of the pros: while day trading what do you think of putting out an initial position (easy to cover if needed) &nbsp;when a technical starts forming (anticipating a flag, or breach of support/resistance, 1OP cross…whatever you’re waiting for) waiting for confirmation and then adding full position or doubling down? &nbsp; I imagine it depends on the strength and anticipated length of the trend but logically you’d like to have a larger position earlier rather than later. &nbsp; &nbsp;I’ve played around with adding a small amount at every pullback &nbsp;or rejection as the trend develops and doing a starter then punching it once confirmed. &nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>In general you want the indicators to trigger and you want price confirmation before you dip your toe in the water. <b>The second mouse gets the cheese</b>. Even with 1OP it will often have a bullish cross off of a deep low and it looks like a great buy, then it crosses back down and the market continues lower. The only “cheating” I might do is if I have signs that market support if forming (tiny bodied candles, marginal new lows on SPY, bullish hammer or bullish engulf, tails under body for a number of candles and a pending 1OP cross on SPY). If during this time a stock has been ticking higher and it has all of the characteristics we look for (incredible D1, technical breakout, heavy volume, M5 relative strength, &gt; prior day high) I will take an early position with the intentions of adding.&nbsp;<p></p>

                <div>That said, you have a super strong market, a super strong stock and a dip in the stock, there you can start to nibble a little early if the momentum is super strong. Then add as the stock regains its upward momentum. Super important that the market tailwind is there and the stock is incredibly strong (consecutive long green candles stacked with little overlap and heavy volume. first bull flag is a buy). Then it is ok to scale in and be a little early. Why? Because you are not calling a reversal, you are trading a continuation and you are trading the middle of the move!!!</div>

                <p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS FRIDAY – Let’s keep the comments light today. There are opposing market forces and that is creating a lot of volatility from one day to the next. The price action is news driven and once the momentum is set, the market continues in that direction. Most of this is program driven. This is a low probability environment for longer term swing trading, but it is great for day trading. </p>
<div>This morning the jobs report came in at a miserable 210K (500K+ expected). That tells us that the economy is not growing as quickly as expected. The silver lining was that hourly wages only increased .3% and that will take some pressure off of inflation (labor is the highest input cost for companies). </div>
<div>The market reaction was bullish. Traders see a weak jobs number as dovish for interest rates because it gives the Fed breathing room. I would caution that line of thinking. The Fed said this week that inflation is NOT transitory and that it is persistent. Powell talked about accelerating the pace of tapering. Central banks around the world are ready to ease QE and some have started to hike rates. Declining economic activity and rising inflation have never been a good combination for the market (longer term). The next FOMC meeting is in 12 days and I doubt we will test the all-time high before then. </div>
<div>Stock valuations have not been this rich since the tech bubble of 2000. Perfection is priced in and the back drop is NOT perfect. Swing traders should be keeping long risk exposure to a minimum. At most, have a few nice bullish put spreads on. Keep your distance and take advantage of accelerated time decay. Watching the day to day price action can give you whiplash. This is a warning sign that conditions are changing. </div>
<div>Day traders should wait for the early action to unfold. Once the market momentum is established, join it. When the move starts to stall (tiny bodied candles, mixed candles, compression) you should start to take gains (scale out). When a reversal looks likely, take the remaining gains and consider trading in the opposite direction. In general, I prefer to trade from the long side. Wait for those dips and buy. If I am trading the short side I do NOT to spread myself across more than 1 or 2 stocks and often I just trade S&amp;P 500 futures. The snap back rallies can be violent and I need to close those trades quickly. The market is going to try to rally above the high from Thursday. Long green candles stacked with little overlap and a breakout on the first attempt would be bullish. Give it time and see if that breakout holds. If it does, we will grind higher. If the market quickly backs off of $460, take a deep breath and wait. Bullish speculators will be anxious to buy the open and they could quickly be flushed out. </div>
<div>Look at the price action the last week. Understand what the bars are telling you!! From my viewpoint, we can expect volatility. There is no reason to chase a move. You will have plenty of opportunities to enter trades on your terms. Be patient and wait for those set-ups. </div>
<div>Support is at the low from Wednesday and resistance is at the high from Wednesday. These are “inside days”. </div>

                <div>Market has spend time on the lod (40+ min) and the threat of a big drop is small just because of that. SPY also would find support at lod from Wed. Armed with that info you notice HPQ ticking higher – start scaling in</div>

                <div>So if you started nibbling on HPQ you had time on the first red SPY candle and most of the second to exit with a scratch or tiny loss. Because you were just starting to nibble it would not be a big deal. However, if you were buying SPY/ES looking for that bounce to continue, you had your @$$ handed to you.

                <div>Remember, 1OP can reverse right back down and keep going lower. You need technical confirmation before you buy.

<div>I may well be wrong – but&nbsp;<span class="caps" style="background-color: var(--bg); ">LOW</span><span style="background-color: var(--bg); color: var(--text); ">&nbsp;is very strong against the market – over the last 7 days SPY has lost $10 and LOW has stayed exactly where it was – maybe down $1.&nbsp; I also feel the market is finding support right now, and despite how bearish today was, I see it as a victory for bulls as bears could not drive SPY below 450 – every attempt was quickly defended and bought up.&nbsp; Finishing the day with a strong rally.&nbsp; Next week if SPY rallies off this support, I believe LOW will break out of compression into an ATH with no resistance ahead it.&nbsp; Like I said, I may be wrong but that is my reasoning.</span><p></p>

                <div>But there is a lesson here – yes of course I used the 1OP, and of course I drew trendlines – but sometimes you need to sit back and just look at the chart, ask yourself, “What is happening here?” What are buyers and sellers doing?&nbsp; – When you look at SPY today, Buyers took the SMA 50 and tossed it aside – do you see any serious selling pressure that challenge that?&nbsp; The run up that started at 11:45am should have sealed that deal for you – Buyers took control.&nbsp; Does that mean you should go long overnight? No – although it would be a defensible position – it does mean if tomorrow continues this trend, you can start to put on Bullish Put Spreads, you can maybe even do long calls – in other words you can be bullish without worrying the rug is going to be pulled out from under you.</div>

<div>I have to also add that November has been probably my been my best month of 2021 (need to check stats later). And this has been without 1OP, without any of the optionstalker daytrade lists such as heavy buying, red hot etc, no 1OSI, no buy/sell arrows… but how? Simply by using popBull, and the daily chart first a la DaveW criteria – “If the daily looks crap im not interested”. Then its a matter of finesse to find an entry on the m5 whether its a pullback and hold of RS during market stall, or a slight pause and continuation higher. So to reiterate whats been said… dont be overcomplicating things. Less is more.</div>

<div>I’ll give you a thought that is probably opposite of what most will say (which is to take off half and let the other half run) – <i>Lean In</i>.&nbsp; The next time your position is working, <i>add to it.&nbsp; </i>If you are long at $24, and it is now at $24.50, make your avg. $24.25.&nbsp; This does several things – one it is actually the right way to trade, most traders never add to winning positions and you should – the trade is working, why take off anything, put in more!&nbsp; The other thing it does is psychological – let’s say that position goes up to $24.75 and you have 2,000 shares at $24.25, instead of 1,000 shares at $24 – you are now up $1,000 instead of $750.&nbsp; &nbsp;Much easier to take profits now, because you will feel you satisfied your “greed” by adding to the position.&nbsp; It is a strange thing, but it works.<p></p>

<div>Excellent advice that ties back to the Tom Hougaard videos that @Fox linked a month back! Trading requires abnormal psychology – doing what might be uncomfortable, doing what most people won’t do. To the same point, Hougaard also brings up the other side of the discussion – <i>when your position turns against you, do consider scaling out?</i><p></p>

Without a correct method to press your correct positions, you will never recover much beyond your losses. You need to press your winners and have a larger position when you are correct. You always want a larger position when you get a great move or trending market than when your position isn’t correct. I’m just add to what @PeteS said prior, but it is very very important.</i></p>

                <div>Pete how do I know when to sell? Where should I place my target? If I had a nickel for every time I get asked this question. I am in AAPL. Looks fantastic. Great rel str and D1 breakout. The S&amp;P is almost to the high from prior day so it has $.90 to go. It should hit resistance there so AAPL probably has an easy $1 left.

                <div>If you are hyper-ventilating because the SPY is rolling over, take a deep breath. That was a really nice move higher in SPY and we need to make sure that resistance is in place. Watch for an attempt to get back to the high. If it fails you have a double top lower high, a bearish 1OP cross and a really nice looking short in FB to consider</div>

                <div>Could this be a bullish flag? Yes. That is why we do not have to short right away. Do not chase in either direction. Be calm and let things set up. Then stalk and be ready to enter. If I had FB on my radar as a short, I would be watching every tick vs SPY. SPY up, FB down – good. SPY double top lower high and FB fading… go short.

                <div>So couple of things we have learned. There are buyers and sellers and they are fairly aggressive on both sides. something has changed. 1. Year end rallies are super strong and they are rarely faded 2. The market has been in an incredible trend and every dip has bought aggressively. 3. Conditions are changing. This is a big reversal today and a drop of this nature is NOT what we would expect given that there should be some beg of month fund buying. 4. VXX is staying pretty high and it is challenging 100-day. Typically, there is not uncertainty into year end. There is a nice orderly market float higher. This tells me that the selling pressure is steady 5. TLT should be dropping after Fed speak. It was hawkish. TLT is moving higher and that is a “risk off” trade (flight to safety).&nbsp;</div>

<div>TA is just indicators of price action – we use the RS/RW method, combined with the prognosticating ability of the 1OP gives us a surrogate that is protected from market dynamics, it allows for constant setups throughout the day, and produces an incredibly high win rate and profit factor.&nbsp; &nbsp;My last 130 trades or so that were posted live, as they happened, have a win rate over 94% with a profit factor in the 40’s.&nbsp; TA is useful to help guide the underlying structure of the method here.&nbsp; You would need to watch the videos and read the wiki here: https://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/wiki/index<p></p>

And this has been without 1OP, without any of the optionstalker daytrade lists such as heavy buying, red hot etc, no 1OSI, no buy/sell arrows… but how? Simply by using popBull, and the daily chart first a la DaveW criteria – “If the daily looks crap im not interested”. Then its a matter of finesse to find an entry on the m5 whether its a pullback and hold of RS during market stall, or a slight pause and continuation higher. So to reiterate whats been said… dont be overcomplicating things. Less is more.</div>

                <p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS TUESDAY – A couple of weeks I suggested keeping your swing trades to a minimum. When we got the bid drop Friday I told you not to panic on a holiday shortened session. This was a warning and you needed to aggressively pare your risk on the bounce Monday. This bull market has been strong and I was fairly confident we would get a bounce. Sunday night I did a video and I explained why we were likely to get another drop Monday or Tuesday. This morning the S&amp;P 500 is down 35 points before the open. </p>

<div>I would not rush in to buy bounces this morning. The second wave of selling needs to run its course. Dip buyers from Monday are going to take a little heat today and they will be flushed out. Longer term swing traders who have long exposure might have weathered the drop Friday and they did not lighten positions yesterday. I know that because we had a gap and go formation. If “risk off” was heavy, we would not have rallied like we did. </div>
<div>Swing traders: This second leg lower will confirm (or violate) support. The second mouse gets the cheese. Wait for technical support that is above the low from Friday. If we get another big bounce and a strong close today, you can sell out of the money bullish put spreads. Expect to take a little heat. If the market closes near the low from Friday, we have more work to do on the downside and you should hold off on bullish put spreads. </div>
<div>Day trader: I believe an early bounce today will set up an excellent short. Be patient and wait for a good 1OP cross. </div>

                <div>I currently view the price action as bearish on SPY. Typically we would see an early bounce after a drop like this. The fact that buyers can’t spark a rally tells me that they are passive and that sellers are more aggressive</div>

                <div>Question – why wasnt it a good idea to short SPY at around 1pm est? that candle closed below 456.84 which was the low of the 12:20 candle and also the halfway point of 12:15 candle. Why wasnt that considered enough confirmation to go short and enough confirmation that the LOD would be tested again after a bearish 1OP cross and after we knew it would be a bearish trend day and after a wimpy bounce? The 1:05 and 1:15 candles seem to me as more confirmation of the short there as they tested the high of the 1pm candle and then got smacked down to the low. The only thing I can think of that would invalidate that price action as confirmation is watching to see if SPY would form a double bottom higher low. Is that why i didn’t see any red traders short SPY? Also, say that you did short it, would the high of the 11:15 candle be a good stop or is that too wide of a stop considering hindsight is 20/20?</div>

When you remove all of the marginal trades from your P&amp;L you will realize that it only takes a handful of nice trades to knock the cover off of the ball. Plus it is so much less nerve racking to be in and out and in and out. Trading is also much more relaxing because you are not hawking every tick.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;Give more room is fine start with a range you expect (XYZ) to be in intraday, add 1/4 size to start for a while, and add on lower end of expected intraday range (with stop under that) or breakout of higher end of expected range (high end break out needs to have room to go as well before next level). Also never forget to check why a move like that is happening. Just so happen to be huge red bars printing on SPY 5 mins after your entry.

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;No problem, Im just avoiding looking at email’s here at work before i leave. For me personally breakout intraday buys are partial size and add on confirmation. I like buying withing the consolidation before the expected breakout, but the consolidation has to be high quality and on multiple time frames. I like to use the 189 min chart and 15 min chart intra day, and the weekly and daily chart as confirmation. And to add to daves note the most important factors need to be RS and trading with the daily trend.</p>

<div>(1) Must have a bullish or neutral view on the market at time of entry, </div>
<div>(2) Daily chart must be bullish (based on recent trend and candlesticks) and with 1OSI &gt; 0 on D1 </div>
<div>(3) Stock must be above it’s 8-day EMA </div>
<div>(4) The 3-EMA must be above the 8-EMA on the M5 chart </div>
<div>(5) No major (50, 100, 200) SMAs on the daily chart above that could act as resistance (within 2% of stock price) </div>
<div>(6) Must be relatively strong today, with 1OSI &gt; 0 on the M5 </div>

                <p><b>@Abie</b>&nbsp;I mentioned this a few days ago. SPY is a fickle animal and it is MUUUCH more difficult to trade than stocks so you have to treat it with respect. If I am trading SPY entry is CRITICAL. No movement and I am out in 10 min. You see that in my comments for every trade I do. Once you had the big drop you either had to short when the bounce ran out of steam (risky because you do not know if the bounce was done) or wait for the lod to be breached. Anything in between is no man’s land</p>

                <div>I think everyone should keep in mind when you see a trader take profits on a position it doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t believe it can run further, it simply may have hit their profit target. This wasn’t intuitive to me at first, but after being in the chat for several weeks know it’s important to keep in mind. Often you’ll see the same trader go back into the stock later and take another $2 out of the stock. Benefit of all the featured traders is to learn not to follow.</div>

                <div>this may surprise you but i have never read a book on trading. I have been in over 100 chat and strategy rooms&nbsp; studied and tested countless strategies from the web and webinars and discarded most of the info. Other than psychologically i really dont think anything you find in trading books will be helpful in your trading. Additionally, the market is changing all the time and algos are programmed to know what retail traders are doing and trade to take advantage of that and causing retail traders to lose and the method they reasd about to fail.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>I have an honest question for everyone (well, almost everyone) – So the method here is very straightforward, we use clean charts with SMA’s (50,100,200) and EMAs (8 and maybe the 3 on the 5 minute).&nbsp; You will occasionally here about VWAP, but not often – we use trendlines which are about as simple to draw as can be, and sometimes Heiken Ashi candles.&nbsp; And of course we look at volume.&nbsp; We have the 10SI giving you a very clear look at Relative Strength, and the 1OP which is now for stocks as well – there are even green and red arrows.&nbsp; The method stresses the importance of the daily chart, and of course the market.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are videos, an entire Reddit wiki, and live analysis as it happens.&nbsp; Using all that – the win rate amongst the traders in Red here is well over 85%, and these aren’t just 2 cents smash and grabs, they are usually substantially profitable wins.&nbsp; So with all that, I honestly want to know – what is the urge to keep looking at other methods and theories, which are the same ones that everyone else uses and generally does so unsuccessfully.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am really not being critical, I am genuinely curious.&nbsp; It is one thing to master this and then want to learn as much as you can.&nbsp; But if you haven’t mastered this – isn’t the constant search for other techniques making it even more difficult?&nbsp;</div>

<div>The problem is most traders who “learn on their own” lose their accounts and fail and this is especially true for traders trying to start trading using scalping or momentum trading.

I know it’s not a new complaint because I am always here reading and I know Hariseldon particularly agrees with me. But yeah, definitely goes on ad nauseam sometimes.&nbsp;</div>

<div>This is actually really huge.&nbsp; There isn’t a successful trader out there that isn’t also resourceful and hard working.&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s not like the professional traders don’t ask each other questions – we do – but, if one of us were to ask a question, you can bet we researched everything there was before asking it.&nbsp; &nbsp; When I see someone ask a lazy question, when just the slightest bit of effort on their part would have revealed the answer it is a huge red flag.&nbsp; And that red flag matters, because each of us devotes a great deal of time in people – and we only have so much time to devote, so we want to make sure that time isn’t wasted.&nbsp; Over the years, and I am sure the rest will agree with me, it becomes clear very quickly who will “make it” and which ones “won’t” and lazy questions are one of those clear signs.<p></p>

<div>To be honest, &nbsp;I have exited trades based on call outs by some of the featured traders here. I was quasi-gamma scalping MSFT with front week short calls (against my back week long call position) before Hari announced his short entry. I was quite happy that somebody else was in the same trade as me, and I was planning on letting it ride its way down until a bullish confirmation &nbsp;(3/8 EMA cross, or bullish 1OP divergence, or higher low support formation on either SPY or the underlying), but Hari announced before the 12:00 candle that he closed his shorts. Even though I haven’t seen any confirmation myself, I followed him and closed my short calls because I obviously don’t want a position that’s contrary to an expert. Surely enough, that was the literal LOD! It may seem like I’m using his call outs as a crutch, but I do wonder if this form of “follow” trading can aid in building trading intuition…</div>

<div>Look at SPY M5, and look at the time MSFT LOD came in – what is the 1OP doing, right as SPY was putting in a double bottom?<p></p>

Sometimes the values for me read something like 1OP1 = 1.25 &amp; 1OP2 = 2.5 and then others they are several orders of magnitude different such as 1OP1 = 5766 &amp; 1OP2 = 5455.

                <div>The market was compressing and a breakdown below the lower end of the compression on a bearish cross was a good short. According to textbooks, that is not a bullish hammer that I annotated, you would need to see a green bar meaning the close is higher than the open. As far as I am concerned if I get a candle like that with a long tail under the body and the close is above the half way point of the range for that bar, it is good enough. The two green bars after that low confirm the buy.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Careful having too much of a bias on a stock – if for example, you have a bullish bias on TSLA all day, you start to see every drop as a reason to buy, and every bounce as confirmation.&nbsp; Look objectively at TSLA – it is range bound at the moment and going nowhere.&nbsp; Not saying the Lottos might not work, just pointing it out in general – it is something we all do, get fixated only one stock and one direction for it.<p></p>

<div>That is a good question and it might require a chart. If some of you can find two examples and post them I will add them to this reply. In general, You want the stock to stay close to the high of the day. You do not want a major retracement and you do not want the stock to spend much time &lt; EMA (8). The market does play a role. If the market is strong, the stock might also be strong, but just taking a breather. As the market moves higher, the stock might tread water and it will look relatively weak even though it is still strong based on the entire move during the day to that point.&nbsp;

                <div>There is also a scenario where the market pulls back at that same time and the stock pulls back more on a relative basis. In those cases you need to be more cautious. It is profit taking and some of the pullback is market related and some of it is profit taking. The best stocks will join the market drop temporarily, but as the market continues lower, the stock will find support at a higher level and compress. In this case, it is still one that you want to buy when the market finds support.</div>

                <p><b>@Pete</b>&nbsp;<b>@moo </b>I think those are important distinctions definitely – it is one thing for a previously strong stock to flatline as Stock goes up, or even drop some, as every stock needs to take a breather – but it is another if you see other stocks in the sector doing the same thing, and it is definitely a warning sign if a market drop triggers heavier selling than expected proportional to SPY.&nbsp; It seems there are some situations where you keep an eye on it, but you don’t take action, and other where the reversal is more meaningful.&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@MiakaSHW</b>&nbsp;my advice is to start simple – technical analysis can get overwhelming <i>fast</i>.&nbsp; There is an indicator for everything, and eventually you’ll start looking at a chart and think if you look at it one way it is bullish, but if you look at it another, it is bearish – and that is because if you go too far down the rabbit hole, you can use technical analysis to justify any position.&nbsp; So start with the basics – Simple Moving Averages and the EMA 8 on the Daily charts, VWAP and the EMA3 and 8 on the 5 Min chart.&nbsp; &nbsp; Basic patterns like Bull and bear Flags.&nbsp; The importance of volume. Etc. Get to the point that with just those indicators you can look at a chart and have a directional bias.</p>

                <p><b>@Bez</b>&nbsp;The best hedge is to reduce risk. That is why it is critical to look at the market context on a longer term basis. Up here your overnight risk should be tiny. If you get caught, it really depends on your exposure. If you are short bullish put spreads and the market tanks, the delta on the short puts will not be that high because they are OTM so you do not need a perfect hedge. It also matters if this is just an intraday dip or a sustained market decline that has a few days under its belt</p>

                <p><b>@Sky</b>&nbsp;Easy solution. Take profits on half of the position when you get the urge to sell. Let the other half ride and place your stop just above your entry price. That way you can’t lose money on the remaining half and it has a chance to run. It will also be much easier to manage and you won’t be as emotional about it. You should be scaling out.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>There should be scenarios that you will not trade because they do not offer enough upside or because they are too risky. Buying opening “gap and goes” near a relative high is one I will not trade. Shorting down here even on a breakdown is one I will not play. No momentum and you shorting a market that has been strong. It will be easy for them to trigger a buy program to force short covering. Then you get a nice 10 pt S&amp;P bar and you are screwed.&nbsp;</div>

<div>HPQ has a nice D1 chart, but it needed to get thru resistance and it did not. The stock M5 tried twice when the market was still strong and no go. Relative strength for HPQ was good with an hour left, but you needed to have the M5 SPY chart up. Relative strength does not mean close your eyes and everything will be fine. All stocks will eventually cave in to heavy market selling. You had a few bars where you could have exited for a tiny loss. The stock did what it was supposed to and it gave you time to evaluate market conditions. When the SPY broke the up trend on consecutive red bars you should have bailed.&nbsp;<p></p>

If the stock is down because of a market dip and it still has rel str you can stay the course. If you are day trading and you buy a stock it is best to stay true to that game plan and day trade it.

                <p><b>@Pete</b> A few questions: When you see the stock going higher when the market is drifting lower, do you scale in with a small size or do you wait for the market to find support first? Also, when adding to your winners, do you always average up or do you average down in certain situations (ex. bull flag pattern)?</p>

                <div>I think you can gauge how I like to trade by my commentary the first hour of the day. I am constantly looking for market clues. The selling was heavy and the long red candles were a bearish sign that kept me out of longs. On a different day with mixed candles and no clear market direction, I would view that as a sign of support and I would not worry about the market and I would start scaling in earlier</div>

                <div>The same is true on the short side. If you think the lod is going to be tested, you have to be short well above it. Once it gets there you want to see an instant breakdown (no pause). If you were not short ahead of the breakdown, you have to watch the next two bars to make sure that it was not a head fake</div>

                <p><b>@Joe H</b>&nbsp;That is a good question. It is so @#$% hard to make money on the short side that by nature your shorts should be half the size of longs. Cash is delta neutral also. If you find the right stock for shorting, take the trade. It is always best to look at both sides of the market. That keeps you aware of sectors/stocks that are weak. My approach would be to trim your size and trade count down on longs. If a decent short surfaces, take it, but don’t worry about balance. The market trend is still higher</p>

<div>Stick to your game plan. When you start making money with A+ consistently you can consider branching out. The worst thing you can do is to start the day off with an early loser. that taints everything and it puts you in the wrong mindset because you have to work out of a hole.<p></p>

</blockquote>
<div>Good question. Hard to give you a definitive answer because conditions change quickly.&nbsp; the ultimate is if a bullish 1OP cross SPY coincides with a bullish 1OP cross in the stock. Reference QCOM bullish cross at 1:05 and SPY bullish cross at 12:50. you had both crossing so you were able to enter when market and stock were finding support<p></p>

                <p><b>@Corey</b>&nbsp;If 1OP is bullish and the cycle is not over-extended (spiking) I am good entering a trade. Just have to be a little cautious if it is spiking and if SPY late in cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Those set backs are demoralizing. At some point in your career you will decide never to let that happen again. If you make your target early in the day, don’t give a penny of it back. Trade 1 share if you need to stay engaged. When you change your behavior it will turn your trading around. You had no business trading the afternoon session on an inside day with no volume.&nbsp;<p></p>

<div>To this end – an easy side by side would be to open up a paper account – and then for every option trade you make, make the same trade in the paper account, but use Stock instead.&nbsp; At the end of the day compare the two and see the difference in your rate of return.<p></p>

                <div>but i agree — i struggle with entering during strength vs on a pullback. on swings, i think buying strength is easier. that said i waited for an intraday pullback (but not D1 pullback) to enter</div>

                <p><b>@Joe H</b>&nbsp;Good question. The longer term SPY view for the next week is important for overnight longs. You want to make sure that you are not in the middle of a steady decline. Heavy selling into the close for a couple of straight days is not good. We are not seeing that now so OK to take some swings. When you do see heavy selling for a few days/weeks, you have to trim overnight bullish swing trades. The good news is that once that support is in (and provided that you are in a longer term bullish market trend), that decline will provide and incredible opportunity to buy overnight swings</p>

                <p><b>@Pete</b>&nbsp;This question stems from your comments over time preserving at least a 50% move at critical junctures. I do use fib calculations with swing structure and individual candles on 5 min. You stressing this has helped me. Todays close I did swing a few overnight nothing big. Getting close to 75% win rate if I stay away from the Parabolic moves early AM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <div>the target depends on what you bought and the price you bought it at. usually at the first indication of momentum loss i will take profits if i have them as opposed to riding out a pullback ;looking for more. So passive means take profits at the first opportunity when momentum stalls&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Hello all, can anyone help me understand an option price? Last Friday, I was watching UNP. At around 10.45, it was on the verge of breakout, gaining RS in D1. In terms of its M5, it was also about to breakout with RS at the time so I thought it could go higher if SPY managed to breakout. When the SPY breakout really happened, the stock had a rally. I made $1 per stock from the trade.  </p>
<div> </div>
<div>But when I look at price change of a call option (ITM 240 strike, expires 19 Nov), the price didn’t move over the rally. The price jumped at 11.30, but I’d have already exited at 11.25 when the long red candle erased last part of leg. Basically, if I bought calls instead of shares, I wouldn’t have made money.</div>

                <p><b>@Alex</b>&nbsp;3 things to this:&nbsp; 1. the 240 strike had/has a delta around 0.70 (0.68 on Friday’s close) so for every $1 move higher in the underlying stock the call option will gain about +0.70/share.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The stock gained $1.70 over the time horizon above so the option should gain approx 70% of this or +1.20.&nbsp; At 10:45 est (your entry) the option shows a price of 3.95, on the 11:30 and 11:35 bars the option traded at 4.80 and up to a high of 5.13.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; The volume in those options is extremely low at only 44 contracts traded on Friday so you would have to be working the exit price on the option as the stock moves higher either with a passive target or adjusting the exit between the bid/ask.&nbsp; &nbsp;The option trade over those time frames would have made money but you have to be managing your exit carefully with pinpoint accuracy selling into strength</p>

                <div>remember with options, that time decay works against you and that decay is non-linear, ie. the closer you are to expiration the faster it decays.&nbsp; Hence being long options requires impeccable timing and skill on entry and exit and the rewards can be great but profits can evaporate quickly into losses if the stock turns against you and you are left holding an asset with a known expiration date</div>

                <p><b>@Bez</b>&nbsp;I use time stops more for futures than I do stocks. Futures can often turn on a dime so you have to be more careful and you need the move right away. Strong stocks will often make a move, pause (consolidate recent gains) and then make another run. You can give stocks more time to go, but if the market is lifting off and the stock is dead, I will take some of the position off.</p>

                <div>I remember way back when I started here, back when I was dealing with wild swings in my balance, overall profitable, but in retrospect there was more than a little luck involved (or as Dave says, the horseshoe on my ass).  And I was introduced to Lotto Fridays.  Well when you introduce Lotto Fridays to a gambler like me, without any real training or the level of control I’ve learned since – you can imagine the outcome.  I was firing off huge Lotto trades, I am talking .10 contracts, and doing 500 to 1,000 contracts, committing over $10K into the trade.  And then the worst thing happened – I hit – big.  Why was making money the worst thing?  Well as any Gambler will tell you, it is that first win in the casino that is the most costly, and this was no exception.  On the heels of that huge win, I proceeded to engage in some of the worst trading in my trading career.&nbsp; &nbsp;It went bad fast.&nbsp; Really fast.&nbsp; So please, please, listen to&nbsp;<b>@Pete</b>&nbsp;– Lottos are fun, and if you do them right, they are profitable – but keep your position sizes small.</div>

                <div>Btw – separate topic – one thing seems clear with so many new and even not so new traders, they do not have the concept of <i>priced in</i>&nbsp;fully understood.&nbsp; &nbsp;People need to understand that 1) Institutions move markets, not retail traders, 2) Any theory you can come up with, and prognostication you might have based on your anecdotal observations (i.e. with the pandemic lessening, more people will be driving, which means more cars will breakdown, so I am going to go long Autozone!) has already been considered and analyzed to a far greater degree than any retail trader on their own could, by those Institutions, 3) Institutions will buy, sell, hold or pass based on their far superior research, and those decisions are reflected in the charts, which is why we <i>follow the money, not anticipate the money.&nbsp; </i>This is why sometimes when a company exceeds earnings and guidance you still sometimes see their stock drop, because those numbers were already <i>priced in</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

                <div>Btw – I have made an observation on the indicators – if you use both the 1OP and the 10M0 together, you will notice times when they diverge from one another – the 1OP might be giving a bullish signal, and the 10M0 is giving a bearish one, both at the same point in time – it seems that when this happens it has a neutralizing impact and the stock remains essentially flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@kman</b>&nbsp;As we have said many times, we post our exits.&nbsp; I know it is hard to understand not being in this position, but when you are publicly posting trades that you know people are following, it is like nails on a chalkboard to constantly be asked , “are you still in?”&nbsp; Search the chat – if you don’t see an exit, we are still in.&nbsp; If you want to know why we are still in, then ask after hours, and since it is not time-sensitive (as you’re saying it is not because you have a position, although earlier you suggested it was, but I am trading and so I will ignore the confusion), then there is no problem waiting.</p>

                <div>Btw – an observation – I think some of the confusion on exits comes from this – You can have two traders, both make the same trade, one trader is looking at the daily chart and comfortable holding the position overnight, so that trader is giving the trade a lot of leeway.&nbsp; A market dip (like the one we are having now) can cause stocks that even have relative strength to break intraday technicals; that doesn’t faze the trader that is confident in the daily chart.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another trader in the same trade is not looking to hold the position – maybe they just like to be in cash at the end of the day, maybe they don’t like what they see in the market, or maybe they want the buying power freed up (i.e. there are a lot of reasons), and so therefore when the stock breaks intraday technicals they exit the position for the loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;Same trade, two different traders – both are correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>So if some of you remember, a few weeks back I spent some time experimenting with hedging and balancing the portfolio.&nbsp; For me, and my style of trading, that practice paid off on a day like today.&nbsp; I started off with a Bullish bias, and it really wasn’t until SPY broke below 463.75 that I started to get more bearish.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, throughout the day I hedge each step of the way – was I long TSLA? yes – but also short GOOG, was I long RIOT? Yes, but I used the stock instead of options because I can hold the stock until it recovers, I chose stocks like EIX that were completely oblivious to SPY and not impacted either way, I used spreads like the dual Butterflies on AMZN and the BPS on RBLX,&nbsp; I made sure my longs <b>very</b>&nbsp;strong daily charts, increasing my standard there, and continuously hit short like DOCU, and MS, throughout the day,&nbsp; &nbsp;I ended up 4.3%.</div>

                <div>I am spending way too much time going through this posts and trying to stop trades that do not meet with our standards – so thank you Pete for that rule.&nbsp; Everyone here brings a certain method of trading that they used in the past – chances are for most of you, that method was not successful. You can of course trade whatever you want, it is your money – but as far as this room is concerned – post <i>only</i>&nbsp;those trades that conform to the method taught here.&nbsp; And if you don’t know the method here than you shouldn’t be posting.&nbsp; Some of you clearly know better, so hopefully this wake up call will stop the constant bad trades being thrown out into the room.&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Thanks for this post I will try to follow this better this week. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>It is hard not to get fomo when people are taking like 5 trades in the first 15 minutes of the day. So what is the reasoning for some featured traders “ignoring”, for lack of a better term, the strategy written here? Using the term “experience” confuses me because if following this advice is what makes you a profitable / experienced trader then why wouldn’t you stick with this plan even years down the road? </div>
<div>This question is all regarding the whole waiting to feel out the market instead of jumping right into strong stock idea. Maybe the real question I’m wondering is what has years of experience taught you that allows you to jump right in? (Not all featured traders, just some) </div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

                <div>Here was my response: “I am 240 yards out from the green and you tell me to lay-up. Why do I see Dustin Johnson going for the green? You do not have that shot in your bag… yet.

                <div>This would be my answer – as one that sometimes takes those trades: 1) Most featured traders have alerts set from prior days or weeks, I will get many alerts in the morning and most I won’t act on, but some will check all the boxes, even early on and 2) I have said time and time again that momentum trading is a valuable part of any traders toolkit, but it should only be done by those very experienced in how to momentum trade – despite what all the YouTube Gurus say, it is the most difficult method of trading one can attempt – featured traders are well verse in momentum trading and thus take advantage of some early gappers.</div>

                <div>It amazes me that all of the “gurus” have been so successful in their marketing attempts that people actually believe that trading is easy and that it requires little to no skill. The poster on Reddit completely dismissed the fact that years of trading experience might matter. Almost as if I just had to tell him what the “secret” was and then he could also trade the open.&nbsp; When I referenced going for the green from 240 yards out, any one who has golfed respects how hard that shot is to pull off and that only a great golfer should attempt it. This is not an easy way to make a living. When Dustin Johnson has a bad day on the course, they do not take money away from him.</div>

It is a sport where you have to practice and where you have to stay within your own game and not worry what others are doing. There is a mental aspect to it and like trading it is extremely competitive. The barriers to entry are also low. All you need is a set of used clubs.</div>

                <div>@Hariseldon I guess I just don’t really understand why the price of the shares matters. The result is the same between someone who buys 14 shares of a $336 stock like MSFT, and those shares move by let’s say 1%, and someone who buys 140 shares of a $33.6 stock, and the price of the shares moves by 1%. “Too expensive” implies that the issue is that someone with a smaller account can only get a few shares, but I’m not sure why the amount of shares they can get matters.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>That seems like an arbitrary way of looking at the movement of a stock. Like if a stock splits from $100 to $10, buying/selling pressure that would have changed that stock price by $1 before isn’t going to still change it by $1 – it will change it by $0.10 with the new post-split price which is the same 1% move as before&nbsp;</div>

                <div>I understand what you are saying. I think most people who are daytrading may not want to hold an expensive stock for such a large move. Even if it is the equivalent of a cheaper stocks smaller move. You can trade that way but why would you? Instead of holding fewer shares of an expensive stock and waiting for an entire 1% move, why not buy options and control more shares and wait for the .25% move instead?</div>

                <div>Ok this is my last attempt. Every stock has its own individual expected move at any given point in time. How you determine the expected move is based on your own TA. So, on one day you are looking at MSFT, and based on your TA you think the expected move is .05%. You have a very good feeling about this move because of any number of factors but the bottom line is, this is a play you have high conviction about. SO you have a small account and what do you do? You could buy shares and make a small amount of money on the expected move or you could buy the equivalent dollar value of those shares in options and make a lot more. This is what Hari means when a stock is too expensive. You just can’t compare this setup to another stocks set up. Every setup is different. Every expected move is different. Every risk/reward is different.&nbsp;</div>

Now I could buy 20 shares (with margin), of the $500 stock but now all my buying power is gone. &nbsp;I could also buy 200 shares of the $50 stock, once again using all my buying power. &nbsp;Let’s say further the $500 stock goes up $10 and the $50 stock goes up $1. &nbsp;In both cases I make $200. &nbsp;No difference, right? &nbsp;But what if I buy an ITM call option on the $500 for $10, and with the remaining buying power I can buy 160 shares of the $50 stock. &nbsp;Now I have 2 positions. &nbsp;Both stocks make the same move – I get $160 from the $50 stock, and $800 from the $500 stock (i.e. the option goes from $10 to $18 on the $10 move). &nbsp;Now I made $960 because I was able to not only take advantage of leverage from an option but also maximize my buying power to take advantage of both moves. &nbsp;So yes if my only choice was buying stock than there would be no difference in proportional percent gain. &nbsp;But because “options” are a choice I was able to use my base amount to get both opportunities.</p>

                <div>Bonds very focused on hourly wage component. That is the only explanation for the rally. Wages were down from last month and that decreases inflationary pressure. Normally you would see bonds fall on a strong jobs number because it puts the Fed one step closer to tightening.</div>

                <div>I’m having a hell of a time picking entries. My directional bias is most often correct but I get shaken out easily. My goal is to have a 3:1 R/R when entering a trade but giving trades a wide enough stop will always violate that. I scout the daily for ranges and trade off the M5 trading off support. How can I reconcile a long term profitable R/R with giving trades enough room?&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@JP</b>&nbsp;I urge you to stop thinking of stops as one dimensional (price). You need to consider what the market is doing, if the stock has relative strength and how long you plan to be in the trade. Price is way down the list as far as my stops and I am usually out of the trade before it gets to my stop because I know I am wrong. If I planed on swinging the trade, I am not that concerned with intraday movement</p>

The trade should be working almost immediately and it should give me cushion to work with. Is SPY M5 on a bullish 1OP cross? Is the stock thru technical resistance D1? Does the stock have rel str M5? Is there heavy volume? Is the stock &gt; prior days high? Is the stock on a bullish 1OP cross? All of these checkboxes have to be marked</p>

<div>how immediate do you actually mean? You mentioned that you buy on the open of the next candle, which means that within the next 5 minutes you’re almost guaranteed to have the trade go against you. How long do you usually give the trade to pan out?<p></p>

                <p><b>@jtk176</b>&nbsp;3-4 months of trading is still infancy. It will take time. Patience is seeing a great trade set up and stalking it for the right moment. Watching every tick side-by-side with SPY. SPY red bar, stock green bar… Patience is lining up your lotto picks and waiting for 1OP to drop and bullish cross and not buying until you get that confirmation. Indecision comes from a lack of confidence and not having a systematic decision making process.</p>

                <p>Yeah I get it.  And saying “experience” isn’t much help for people that don’t have experience.  But what “experience” might mean for me, can be compensated by you – for example, I might be trading a stock that I have traded hundreds, maybe thousands of times in the past year.  I know how the stock tends to move, I know the stocks ATR without looking it up, and thus that might impact how I trade it.  But for you – you need to look up those stats on the ticker – how much does it tend to move, does it have consistent volume or is it prone to sudden bursts, does the stock need a burst of volume to move or can it move on just average volume, how independent of SPY is the stock normally, how independent of SPY is it today? Etc.Etc…And I also get it – it seems like there is just a million things to take into account, how can you possibly learn them all.  The answer is you can’t – at least not overnight, you can learn them with practice, with trading smaller size, with trading your paper account.  It is all those little things that you need to build up over time.  Can you be successful without them? Sure – but you better be super selective.</p>

Because I had the second candle off an HA reversal, and I had to chase the Ask in AH – and when I am doing that, the stock has momentum and volume. Simple as that – I saw it, entered, wanted $1, set the target, and then 45 seconds later took profit.&nbsp; Those two things were all I needed there.</div>

                <p><b>@Russ</b>&nbsp;No really, maybe contextually, I mean I am not going to set a $1 target on ADTX like I would for PINS – but that is just because one is a $2 stock and one is $46.&nbsp; My target was I looked at the AH chart after earnings, saw tha $47.45 was the high, I felt it would try for that given the momentum , so I chose to offer about 20 cents below that, which also gives me a $1.&nbsp; The other part is I went long 2,000 shares, and wanted to take $2K out of the trade.&nbsp; So different factors.&nbsp; Now if the stock didn’t hit the target my exit would have required a lot more thought lol.</p>

                <div>Thanks Hari, thanks helpful. I’ve noticed a lot of my exits have tended to be after stocks weaken a bit – i.e. 3 under 8 cross or stocks becomes RW, and feel like I am leaving $$$ on the table. Do you normally put that offer right at entry or only once you’re ready to sell based on price action?</div>

                <p><b>@jtk176</b>&nbsp;I do both D1 and M5 alert lines and I try to do it in the videos as much as I can. If you are flipping charts and you see a good trendline, drop the alert even if you are not trading the stock now. When that alert triggers, it will be a good potential trade. Once I have a stock on my radar, I will drop alert lines above and below the current price. That helps me keep an eye on it while I continue looking for stocks. You can do it on M15 or M30 basis as well, I just don’t use those time frames as much</p>

<div>DE retraced to 357.55 which was the ema8 support at 10.30am .&nbsp; You could have taken cds 357.5/360 when it pulled back to this support and would have made good money if you rode it until break of ema8 at 13.20pm<p></p>

                <p><b>@Tamdak</b>&nbsp;I wasn’t in the trade but I’m also trading with a small account so would like to ask a question related to it. Just for an example, let’s say I took the cds 357.5/360 for 1 (40%) but if the stock started losing its strength (or it lost its reasoning to stay in the trade) so I decided to close the CDS. Then, how much should I expect to lose? It might be a stupid question but I’d like to get my mind ready in losses as well as profits.&nbsp;</p>

But for the inexperienced this can be dangerous as you are moving away from a defined loss scenario to now significant losses if it continues to fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <div>In trying to get to the root of your question, despite the incorrect terms I believe what you are asking is – is the inverse of a spread the same thing?&nbsp; So is a Call Debit Spread essentially the same as a Put Credit Spread, or is a Call Credit Spread essentially the same as a Put Debit Spread, and the answer is – no.&nbsp; Perhaps directionally, somewhat, but even in that case, not really.&nbsp; Each of those spreads have very particular strategies behind them.&nbsp; With an OTM Put Credit Spread, the stock can go down, stay the same, or go up and you will still be fine – time decay is your revenue generating variable here.&nbsp; A Call Debit Spread you want the stock to go up (generally), and you aren’t depending on Theta as much.&nbsp; Etc…etc..</div>

<div>yes, yes, and no.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; I swing as many positions as I can find that I think are likely to succeed based on what I’ve learned from you and the other pros.&nbsp; Normally, due to time and liquidity constraints, it’s 3-4 max per day.&nbsp; My “swing” is usually just overnight.&nbsp; I use spreads, straight options, and stock.&nbsp; And, no, I don’t even understand hedges. lol.

<div>I study constantly, in between “the day job.”&nbsp; I read and reread everything.&nbsp; I can recite posts from memory . . . the way a devotee can recite a prayer.&nbsp; I am not so fantastically disciplined that I don’t make stupid mistakes.&nbsp; Today?&nbsp; I made a stupid mistake.&nbsp; I stayed in the RKT trade too long with no technical way to defend it.&nbsp; I stayed in at first because I was in the red.&nbsp; I stayed in later because I just really didn’t want to be out of the game.&nbsp; It turned out ok, in the green, but that was luck not skill.&nbsp; I want to trade with skill.<p></p>

                <p><b>@LisaM</b>&nbsp;Something to consider -I assume that a large percentage of your capital is tied up in your swings and those swings match the bias of the current day – so if you were swinging positions over the weekend my guess is they are all bullish. &nbsp;Which means if the market opens in the red on Monday you’re in a bit of trouble. &nbsp; I’ll use three types of hedges – 1) Straight Hedge – this is pretty much either VXX calls or SPY puts (or I’ll short futures), &nbsp;2) balanced hedged – this are stocks that are going down as your other bullish positions go up – they are harder to find, but they can be in profit even as your bullish positions are as well, 3) Conditional Hedge, these are weak stocks but if SPY is strong they aren’t dropping, but if SPY drops so do they (AMZN usually qualifies). &nbsp;</p>

                <div>Yes so there is one type of hedge that is a straight hedge, like a SPY put – chances are if this is making money your other positions are not (if they are bullish) however, it is like getting insurance, you spend a certain percent of your money to protect the rest.&nbsp; For example, if you have all your money right now committed to bullish positions and on Monday SPY opens down $5, that is a huge problem for you, no matter how much RS those stocks have – chances are many of them if not all of them will be in the red – however, in the case of a straight hedge you will at least have one thing in profit to take some of the sting off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Or you can use something like SBUX or PYPL, in this case there is a good chance that even if SPY opens higher, they will still be profitable because the daily charts are so weak – Now I would not recommend swinging a short in this market right now, but you could swing it as a hedge against bullish positions – here is something that is SPY were to open down, these stocks would most likely be down <i>even more </i>than they normally would – thus again taking out some of the sting – this is a safer bet.</div>

If the stock is holding firm, it will be one you want to buy. For those of you who do like to short, use smaller size and do not spread yourself across too many stocks.

<div>Wouldn’t that akin to trading P/L? From charts, I see resistance on stock at price X. I would like to sell a CDS when stock reaches that price. So instead of setting a target price with 30% would like to set a target price which is most likely the price CDS would be when stock hits that price X.<p></p>

                <div>JoeH&nbsp; &nbsp;regarding algo lines that are drawn by algos at institutions there are a couple of rules they use regarding which candles to use for tops and bottoms, which candles can be drawn thru. Any candle with very high volume (like a candle created by earnings) are not used as an initiating algo line start. The starting candle will have no nearby candles at the same level. If an algo line is going to cross thru a candles wick that is done if the candle has high volume but if the candle has avg volume the top of that candle has to be used as a contact point.</div>

                <p>I still do not trust this rally for longer term swings. Earnings will favor tech stocks that have smaller payrolls (less of an impact from higher wages) and less exposure to supply shortages. The rest of the S&amp;P 500 will be exposed to lower margins due to higher input costs and the guidance could be cloudy. In the last year when the market has come under pressure we rally back to the high and then the action dies down. I am expecting a fairly dull market this week with an upward bias. The FOMC next week will suppress the appetite for new longs. If the market holds the breakout next week after tech earnings and the FOMC I will reluctantly add some longer term exposure. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>I have been doing so well with day trades and overnight swings that there is no reason for me to extend my trade duration.  </div>
<div>Day traders should not chase the opening gap up. Gaps up to a new all-time high have often been faded in the last year. Wait for the bid to be tested. Stacked long red candles with little overlap in the first 30 minutes will be a sign that the selling pressure is heavy and that there will be a bottoming process. Be patient with your longs if you see this. Long green candles stacked on the open would be a sign that we are going to blow through the all-time high. I see this as less likely given the overnight news. If we get this move trim your trade size (I don’t like to chase at an all-time high). The most likely scenario is choppy trading with a mix of green and red candles today. Traders are going to wait for earnings. A gradual move higher and you can trade stocks that are breaking out through technical resistance on heavy volume and relative strength. A gradual move lower is our best scenario with mixed candles. The mixed candles are a sign that buyers are engaged and the drift lower gives us time to evaluate relative strength.  </div>
<div>I am staying flexible and although I am looking for opportunities on both sides, I do favor bullish plays. I am expecting a dull day today ahead of MSFT and GOOG. </div>
<div>Support is at SPY $454. Resistance is the all-time high. </div>

                <div>It’s a factor of multiple things – (1) having made gains didn’t want to give back and was exiting too early (2) in some cases stopped on blue arrow while TA was telling me to hold on to the trades – again didn’t want to lose (3) read on market was not there as it was chopping around – should have remained in cash without direction (4) sizing was ok – can’t go less than 1 contract but was trying naked calls/puts without spreads so exposure was higher – wrong instrument in uncertain times</div>

                <p><b>@ican</b>&nbsp;The whole “going broke taking profits” resonates with me. My habit is always to exit early. I dont have much of an issue holding losers too long but holding winners too short is my problem. Its common for me to have 1 loss take out maybe 2-4 winners. I look back on trades just about daily and if I had just held on and exited with the chart/TA I would be exactly where I want to be with my $$ goals for a good living. Such a frustrating habit I still can not break not matter how many times I tell myself to follow the chart. There is always this voice in my head going “but this little baby thing over here says you should exit and take what you have”. I know Hari has written about this many times. Its my curse</p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;getting rid of that urge to sell when you have profits and hoping your losers turn around is an issue of pure mindset as you know – but it also comes from selective memory of all the times that you were up on a trade and didn’t take profits, only to see the trades reverse on you.&nbsp; You remember those far more often than the times the stock kept going up after you exited.&nbsp; Try this – if you have ThinkorSwim you can open it twice, one for real money, one for the paper account, set the paper account for the exact same balance as your money account.&nbsp; Do the same trade in each, but in the paper account, trade it like you know you’re supposed to but emotionally can’t do in the money account.&nbsp; Ride the winners, cut the losers in the paper account – and do the money account as normal, like you are now.&nbsp; At the end of the week, compare the two balances.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@Hariseldon</b>&nbsp;I appreciate the help. I will give that a shot. I actually think I am good about not letting my losers run. I set lines on my chart below the technical level where I plan on exiting to remind me that if it goes against me this is where I should be watching.&nbsp; I am pretty good about sticking to it. Its the winners I need to work on. Literally FB alone today would have been huge for me if I didn’t cut it so short. During that same short I had PYPL and PINS on, both cut early, PYPL for scratch (then proceeded to rage down) and PINS I took +.06 when I was hunting for about .30-.40 (which it hit later).&nbsp; I will do my best to dumbify it tomororw. I let SPY spook me too much i think, one SPY candle in the wrong way of my trade and I get scared. I will stick to the 8ema cross, HA reverses, or a big engulfing candle.</p>

                <div>@JF I did this alot and now still sometimes still do.  In addition to what Hari said, I find that doing smaller positions and journaling is a great way to combat this also.  1 or two CDS instead of 4 or 10.  20 shares instead of 100.  then as my success built, I get more comfortable.  as I start to repeat my old ways, I look at what im doing and its, oh hey, 10 CDS.  if it was 2 I would have held…</div>

                <div>a time spread is a fairly simple and low risk trade that is done over earnings. The objective is to capture the IV crush that occurs after earnings as well as the difference in the time decay rates between this weeks calls (or puts) and next weeks.&nbsp; It should be done on stocks that have a history of not making big moves after earnings (usually dont beat expectations bullishly or bearishly. In Petes platform there is a list of all stocks reporting after hours today or before opening tomorrow. Within that list there is a column for % of times exceeded. You want this number to be low (20% or less)</div>

                <div>after earnings are announced the IV will drain out of all the options but this weeks tend to have higher IV than next weeks and this weeks will decay must faster (time decay for next week will decay more slowly)&nbsp; this dynamic will many times allow you to sell the position you established for a debit for more than you paid for it in the range of 10% to 50% as a rule.

                <div>legging out could be done if there is a large move either way but as with any legging out strategy it carried additional above your original risk when you put the trade on. If the stocks shoots up and you think it will contine you can buy back this weeks short call and hold next weeks long call to ride it higher but keep in mind you would have bought back the short call for much more than you sold it for. For me the best course of action is to take your profits or your small loss during the day following earnings, Early the spreads could be wide because the IV will not have completely drained out so selling when the spreads are wide early can be the best course of action</div>

                <p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS MONDAY – The S&amp;P 500 is within striking distance of the all-time high and it has traveled more than 200 points in just over a week. Earnings season is kicking into high gear this week as mega cap tech stocks prepare to release results.  </p>
<div> </div>
<div>FB will post results after the close today. MSFT and GOOG will post earnings after the close Tuesday. AAPL and AMZN will post earnings after the close Thursday. The reaction to these announcements will set the tone for the market and these 5 companies comprise almost 25% of the market cap for the S&amp;P 500. This will be the busiest week of earnings. The misses from SNAP and INTC were completely ignored last week as “one offs” and that is a red flag.  </div>
<div>The momentum has been incredibly strong with gaps higher and stacked green candles closing on the high. The volume is light and that is a sign that there is a seller’s boycott (no one wants to sell).  </div>
<div>These are the market forces in play and the bullish forces are winning. </div>

                <p>Day traders should not chase the opening gap up. Wait for the bid to be tested. Stacked long red candles with little overlap in the first 30 minutes will be a sign that the selling pressure is heavy and that there will be a bottoming process. Be patient with your longs if you see this. Long green candles stacked on the open would be a sign that we are going to blow through the all-time high. I see this as less likely given the overnight news. If we get this move trim your trade size (I don’t like to chase at an all-time high). The most likely scenario is choppy trading with a mix of green and red candles today. Traders are going to wait for earnings and FB could confirm that social media revenues are down and that SNAP was not a fluke. A gradual move higher and you can trade stocks that are breaking out through technical resistance on heavy volume and relative strength. A gradual move lower is our best scenario with mixed candles. The mixed candles are a sign that buyers are engaged and the drift lower gives us time to evaluate relative strength.  </p>
<div> </div>
<div>I am staying flexible and although I am looking for opportunities on both sides, I do favor bullish plays. I am expecting a dull day today ahead of FB. </div>
<div>Support is at SPY $451. Resistance is the all-time high. </div>

That is a pivot. The blue arrow is for a stop loss or to take profits. Avoid stocks when they are range bound and look for strong momentum on D1 and M5 basis. The searches already find these stocks for you. Can I use it with XYZ indicator? Sure. Can I buy opening gaps higher? Sure (if that is something you are comfortable with that always means greater risk and reward). What if I have a buy signal and the market is going down? It is always best to wait for market support. <b>STOP COMPLICATING THIS!</b> I can’t make this any easier.&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@Hariseldon</b>&nbsp;1. Trading the open is no different with the signals or without. It is a matter of risk tolerance and your confidence in the opening move. I do not like trading stocks on the open, but some people do. If there is a big market gap I tend not to trade it. If there is a big stock gap I tend not to trade it unless there are stacked green candles. Higher risk and higher reward trading the open.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Just to clarify, the buy/sell signals are not correlated with 1OP, correct? This buy signal on TSLA @ 10:20am  comes as 1OP has a bear cross, RS is dropping, but 10MO is rising. This is what we are calling a bullish divergence on the stock?</p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;yes they are – first, the 10MO shouldn’t be part it, remember?&nbsp; Next, the buy signals are a combination of the 1OP, the 10SI, volume, etc.&nbsp; When you see a signal that is a buy signal, but the 1OP is dropping or on a bearish cross, that is a divergence, just like it would be for SPY, which means a powerful trend.</p>

                <div>To keep is simple – once the signals are updating in real time – When you see a green arrow – buy, when you see a blue arrow – get out of the trade. When you see a red arrow, sell.&nbsp; When you see a blue arrow, get out of the trade.&nbsp; When you see a Red arrow and then a green arrow, or visa-versa, it is a pivot and reverse the trade.&nbsp; &nbsp; When you see a green arrow but the 1OP is dropping or in a bearish cross, then it is a divergence, indicating a strong trend – when you see a red arrow and the 1OP is rising, with a bullish cross it is a divergence, indicating a strong trend.&nbsp; &nbsp;That’s it.&nbsp; Stick with that and you will be fine.</div>

                </div>
                <div>Also guys, keep in mind, the signals shouldn’t be used to blindly enter trades just because there is a green arrow showing up. If you are going long, you still want to see the bullish daily chart, no SMAs above, no horizontal resistance above, high relative volume, relative strength, etc. – the buy signals are just yet another tool to add to your tool kit (and a fantastic one at that). But just because you see a red arrow come up on that strong stock you were looking at, doesn’t mean you should be going short…</div>

                <p><b>@Hariseldon</b>&nbsp;I have a question for you while you’re still here regarding how you manage chat vs your own research. Any other experienced people can chime in too if they’d like. This question especially applies on busy days (and mornings) like today. I have a really hard time doing both my own filtering through OS scans + my watchlist from pre-market AND trying to look up stocks that people throw out here. Now obviously as a red person you are one of hte main people tossing out stocks but still there are many other qualified people throwing out ideas. Kind of curious how you deal with this? For me it feels like Im in the middle of my own searches and then I see a symbol, oh shit gotta look up that now, ok then back to my searches…then oh crap again another symbol. Im like a dog chasing a ball sometimes haha</p>

                <p><b>@Hariseldon</b>&nbsp;So, is having a set profit target just a bad idea then? Let’s say you have Stock Z at $100 and based on the daily chart, you think the stock can hit $102 by the end of the day. You go long and get immediate cushion as Stock Z jumps up to $100.75. But then about 10-15 minutes later, Stock Z starts going sideways at $101.25 while the market is still going higher, indicating relative weakness. Should you just exit? Or should you hold onto the position a little longer if Stock Z has a strong daily chart (above all major SMAs, relative strength on daily, etc.) and a market tailwind? </p>

                <div>It definitely does, but it is very fluid and situational.&nbsp; Let’s take two examples.&nbsp; One – An OTM Bullish Put Spread.&nbsp; You do a 300/305 BPS for $1, and it expires in 3 weeks.&nbsp; If you are getting $1 and risking $4, it is a 25% ROI.&nbsp; This means you need to have more than an 80% win rate on those trades to be profitable (out of 100 times if you win 80 = $80, you lose 20 = $80 = breakeven).&nbsp; OK, so now based on your reward (25%), and risk (75%), you know how often the trade needs to work in order to be successful.&nbsp; And since you want to make profit consistently, this trade really only works if you are successful 90% or more.&nbsp; Also keep in mind these statistics assume that you keep the trade to its completion either way.&nbsp; The truth is, you might take profit earlier and it isn’t the full $1, you might take the loss earlier and it isn’t the full $4.&nbsp; Or you might leg out of it and still hit your profit goal.&nbsp; But the trade in the beginning can only be judged by the current conditions.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now let’s look at another trade:</div>

                <div>Let’s say you short a stock that has fallen below it’s major SMA’s, it is weak to the market, and dropping rapidly – for example PYPL – a news driven event – on Wednesday you short it at 265, and you are going to use the SMA 200 on the daily as you mental stop.&nbsp; Well, at this point you can exit at the 1OP bullish cross around noon, and take a nice gain.&nbsp; And then re-enter again on Thursday.&nbsp; Or you can swing the stock given the daily chart.&nbsp; Here your profit target is fluid, and based on your goals.</div>

                <p><b>@Hariseldon</b>&nbsp;Ok go it! For credit spreads though, I always thought it’s best to do them 30 to 45 days out of expiration. Would theta still work in your favor if you did 2-3 weeks out? My biggest fear when it comes to holding spreads to expiration is getting assigned (pin risk). Would that depend on the situation too: Let’s say I opened up a bullish put spread and I am a week out from expiration and I see that the stock is $15 OTM with the market continuing to go higher. Would I be fine holding this stock through expiration since there’s a very small chance that it will end up being ITM, or should I close it a day or two before expiration just to be safe?</p>

                <p><b>@Andreas</b>&nbsp;“Hot hand” I get it, when the opportunity is there must strike. And wins must be sizeable enough to pay for losses. But our systematic rel str approach is designed to set up “hot hands” for ourselves every session. So no need to get too bulled up based on a recent win streak, which is likely coming from dopamine release not based on any improvement in positive expectancy. The flipside of setting up hot hands for ourselves (high probable RS/RW setups) is that we DO NOT TAKE COLD HANDS. For a trader seeking consistency, that is way more important than playing the good hands. And sizing up just because of a win streak could be basically risking more on cold hands.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>Trading 1 share is an exercise to condition your brain to focus on the execution and timing of the position.&nbsp; But of course inevitably when we scale up the psychology will start to do funny things that it didnt do on 1 share. Fear mindset will quite literally manifest the feared outcome into happening by way of blocking off other psychological pathways (such as the un-feared, positive outcome happening). And the line between fearless and reckless can be deadly hard to see. For me I went from my first 4-figure gains in single trades, thinking I was the next Paul Tudor Jones, to 5-figure losses the following week.</div>

<div>There is no expected outcome in any trade. It took me a long time struggling with this. “Surely if i adjust my strategy I can avoid any drawdown/ increase win rate to 100%” etc etc its all ways of our reptilian brain to avoid pain. Intense periods of concentration (staring at charts all day) is also a form of pain signal for the brain. The pay off for outsized returns on time and capital with trading is that we take some pain from the uncertainty of outcome.&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Day traders should not chase the opening gap up. There is resistance at the all-time high and I believe that the news from INTC, SNAP and HON will keep some pressure on the market. Overseas markets were pretty flat as well, but the Eurozone Flash PMIs were better than expected. Wait for the bid to be tested. Stacked long red candles with little overlap in the first 30 minutes will be a sign that the selling pressure is heavy and that there will be a bottoming process. Be patient with your longs if you see this. Long green candles stacked on the open would be a sign that we are going to blow through the all-time high. I see this as less likely given the overnight news. If we get this move trim your trade size (I don’t like to chase at an all-time high). The most likely scenario is choppy trading with a mix of green and red candles. Traders are going to wait for earnings next week. A gradual move higher and you can trade stocks that are breaking out through technical resistance on heavy volume and relative strength. A gradual move lower is our best scenario with mixed candles. The mixed candles are a sign that buyers are engaged and the drift lower gives us time to evaluate relative strength. </p>

<div>Sorry to beat a dead horse, but considering all candles, trend lines, ma’s and it’s strong into earning, and after, I see the stock continuing north. Do you agree?

                <p><b>@Jeff Pierce</b>&nbsp;I thought you were asking me about the market. Resistance is stiff. Tiny SPY candles to come with a lot of waiting for earnings and the FOMC. Can you go long? Sure if you have the right stock. Is this a great entry point from a market standpoint? No. The easy money was made this week and I tried to make that clear when we broke thru the down slope trendline and the 50-day MA</p>

                <div>Down opens in a bull market are the best scenario for us. Long red candles stacked in the first 30 min… favor the short side. That would be a sign of heavy selling and there will be a bottoming process. No need to rush in and buy if we see that. Long green candles stacked would indicate a gap reversal and you can buy if you see that. This is not the same back drop as we had a week ago when the market was at much lower levels. That is why I did <u>NOT</u> say buy aggressively. The most likely scenario is a choppy mix of green and red candles with little to no direction. Buyers and sellers will battle it out. In the last two days we have seen some resistance (selling pressure) and I pointed it out in the video. We are near the all-time high so the headwinds will be stiff. If the market is directionless for the first 30 min and you see relative strength on a heavy volume breakout you can trade those stocks. Since you do not have a market tailwind, trade smaller size early in the day and set passive targets. The easy money on the long side has been made.</div>

                <div>General rules – 1) you want to get strikes that have at least two major levels of support above your short strike (SMA’s, GAP, Horizontal, trendline, etc.), 2) you want a stock that is bullish on the daily chart, with relative strength, and some HA continuation , 3) you need to get at least .20 cents for every dollar in the spread between strikes, this gives you a 25% ROI, the reason for this is that if you have a lower ROI you need your win rate to be over 90%, 4) never choose a date that is on or after earnings, the IV will hold up the pricing and you won’t get theta decay which is the main advantage – remember these are far OTM strikes, 5) to get that premium required for the credit you need to go 2-4 weeks out but don’t go more than 4 weeks out, the closer to the current date the better.</div>

<div>I know – but you have two things working against you here:&nbsp; 1) we are hardwired to remember those times where a win turned into a loss more than the times when a win turned into a bigger win, and 2) it is probably a very rare occurrence that you let your winners run, so there is a small sample size there.<p></p>

                <p><b>@howler78</b>&nbsp;unless you were born wealthy, and most of us weren’t, I know I wasn’t – it is a problem we <i>all</i>&nbsp;have.&nbsp; Why? Because for most of us – life has sucked. Let’s face it – everything has been a struggle.&nbsp; Everything you have you fought for tooth and nail, worked your ass off for countless hours, and even then, it doesn’t seem to be enough.&nbsp; And whenever something good happens, you just know it will come with a catch – the other shoe will drop, at some point life is just going to kick you in the teeth again.</p>

                <div>That is why we sit there looking at a stock that has fallen way past the point where it is rational to think it will turn around and yet we still <i>believe</i>&nbsp;it will, because we are <i>hoping things get better</i>.&nbsp; And that is why when we have a little bit of profit we grab it and run, because we are worried <i>the other shoe will drop</i>.&nbsp; It is the same core psychological reason.&nbsp; <i style="font-weight: bold;">THAT</i>&nbsp;is what needs to be addressed to truly implement these strategies here, which do work – and work really really well.</div>

</blockquote>
<div>@JF It all depends on your goal – if you’re just looking for a quick pop in let’s sat TSLA , and assuming other conditions are right, then you want to go long at the buy signal and sell at the exit. &nbsp;But if you were looking at a longer play on a stock, let’s say AMD, then you can use it time your entry to maximize your trade, but after that you might want to hold through several cycles or overnight.<p></p>

                <div>the buying has been so heavy the last week that we have to be careful shorting. This looks like legit selling, but it came late in the bear cycle. I would like to see a small bounce here and 1OP move above 0. then lower high double top with another bear cross. That one might have a chance to gain traction. This is speaking strictly from bearish standpoint. On the bullish side, a bull cross, long green candles thru hod negates all of that and we are going higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                </div>
                <div>If the move stalls before the hod and we have a lower high double top then we could see more organized selling. Watch for small green candles in here with a bearish hammer below the hod. That will be your clue on the downside. On the upside a couple of stacked candles with little to no overlap will be the clue</div>

                <div>In the last week I have held some overnight longs, but we were bouncing off of support so I felt pretty confident that the market would move higher the next day and that there might be a gap up. I am not holding many overnight longs now. That is just how I am trading. Many other featured traders have many overnight positions so it really comes down to how confident you are that the market is on sound footing</div>

                <div>Too things are working very well for me given how busy the summer has been personally for me compared to last fall. I have OS open everyday and chat. I squeeze 30 mins in the morning between 9:30-10 for trading.. 8:30-9 is my research period for the day. 9:30 is to check I will or won’t trade the day.. I may or may not enter trades, may or may not post… check at lunch or whatever break I get, and another 30 mins of trading between 2-4 (may or may not trade, manage positions, close positions/go to cash, etc).. all in all, because of OS/Chat, I spend about 1 hour/day if that to trade or manage trade.. chat is open so that I don’t get rusty.. that’s what I do everyday.</div>

                <div>Approx 80% of the time 1OP will predict price movement. The 20% of the time that it does not happens when there is incredible trend strength. In those cases we watch for divergences and they confirm trend strength.</div>

                <p>PRE-OPEN MARKET COMMENTS TUESDAY – Earnings season will kick into high gear in the next week and traders will be focusing on guidance. Year-over-year comps will be harder to beat since we were starting to come out of the depths of Covid-19 and stock valuations have not been this high since the “tech bubble” of 2000. The enthusiasm for earnings is high and the S&amp;P 500 did not even test the 50-day MA Monday. In fact, the gap down only lasted a bar and we were off to the races with a gap reversal. This price action was very strong and this morning we are gapping up. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>The same market forces that were in play early in the week are still present. </div>
<div>Reasons to be bullish: </div>
<div>1.<p></p>

                </div>
                <p>Day traders should not chase the opening gap up. The market has run hard the last few days and I believe that the move up will be challenged this morning. I am NOT looking for a gap reversal and a bear trend day so let me make that very clear. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>If we see a mix of green and red candles and a small move higher (or a series of tiny green candles) it will be a sign that there is selling pressure. Bullish speculators will rush in and they will get flushed out. That dip will provide a shorting opportunity and patient traders will eventually have a great entry point for longs. </div>
<div>It is also possible that we compress before moving higher. That is another good pattern because it confirms that buyers are able to hold the gains and fend off sellers. This compression will give us precious time to find stocks with relative strength. </div>
<div>The final pattern is a drift back into the range with mixed green and red candles. A stubborn drift lower will be a sign that buyers are still engaged and that support will form. This is the ideal set-up today because it gives us time to confirm relative strength. The “fakes” will easily give up gains while the “gems” will grind higher as the market fills in some of the gap. </div>
<div>I am bullish for the next week, but the way I approach my day trading will depend on the market action I see early. On a wimpy move higher on top of the gap up I will look for a shorting opportunity and I will look for bullish speculators to get flushed out. On a compression or gradual drift lower I will be flipping charts and looking for my stocks. Once the market finds support (1OP bullish cross, bullish hammer, bullish engulf…) I will buy them. </div>
<div>Support is at the 50-day MA. Resistance is the all-time high. </div>

                <div>… but Pete, FSLR is moving higher and you missed great profits. I am not remotely worried about selling the whole position at the high of the day because I never will. I have the gains I was hoping for and the position is much easier to manage.&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@jtk176</b>&nbsp;Moo uses the small cap index as a leading indicator for the market directionally.&nbsp; He also uses the $TICK to see the overall ratio of stocks moving up vs those moving down.&nbsp; So what he is saying is that he would need to see both of those indicators point in the same direction before he would consider shorting SPY, which is in addition to the 1OP and the technical pattern on SPY itself.&nbsp; This would give him four distinct confirmations and a high confidence in that short.</p>

                <div>Hey, I’ve been seeing you guys scale in or out of positions and I’m learning that that is the responsible thing to do but for new or less capitalized traders like me, what would you recommend in terms of cultivating a certain kind of mindset if it is many times impossible to scale in or out because it is too expensive? For example, I was holding a TSLA call from friday and since SPY+TSLA were both bullish so I decided to let my winner run trying to take Hari’s advice. But I wouldn’t be able to add bec it is only 1 contract and buying another is just too expensive for me, and i cant scale out bec it is only 1 contract and i dont want to be completely out, so for expensive stocks is often all or nothing. I took very nice gains today from it today but my im wondering if my decision was a bad decision even though it worked out bec i didnt err on the side of caution and possibly developing a bad habit?&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Suppose you could follow every single stock listed on the NYSE and track every few seconds how many of the stocks were trading on upticks versus how many were trading on downticks. What would that information tell you? </p>
<div> </div>
<div>A buyer who wants to own shares aggressively will execute with a degree of urgency and will pay up for those shares. Such lifting of offers will cause stocks to trade on upticks. </div>
<div>Conversely, a seller who wants out of shares aggressively will also execute with urgency and will accept the bid price. This hitting of bids causes stocks to trade on downticks. </div>
<div>By calculating the number of stocks trading on upticks minus those trading on downticks every few seconds, the NYSE TICK is an immediate, real time sentiment survey. It is based on the actual transactions in a broad stock universe and thus represents what traders are actually doing, not just what they say they’ll do in a survey.</div>

                <div>something to keep in mind is that trading is not supposed to be like a thrill ride. You should not be trading for an adrenaline rush. It is a business of discipline, risk reward, risk and money management. You also have to be trading strategies and methods with high (75%+) win rates. It takes a very long time (2 or more years) t become&nbsp; a somewhat proficient trader and you will go through many emotional highs and lows. You can become a consistently successful trader but it takes time and it is difficult</div>

If he keeps doing that, eventually he will be in a position to hit one of those because his first goal is to retain possession as long as possible.</div>

                <p><b>@gabazine</b>&nbsp;the reason to be focused on 75% win rates is connected to mental impact that losing trades have on you psyche vs the minimal effect winning trades have on your psyche. Losing trades impact your mind set negatively and studies have shown a trader needs a 75% win rate to overcome that mental negativity. There are some traders (very few) that can be profitable with a 50 or 60% win rate and a 2 to 1 profit vs loss roi but they are few and far between&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@jtk176</b>&nbsp;there are only a few instruments where you can keep increasing size significantly. Besides the additional risk you take on it becomes impossible to exit or enter without impacting the instruments price sometimes in a big way. All big institutions have to scale into and out of positions over time and quite often that is months. The notion of just keep increasing your size toward infinity is a fallacy</p>

</blockquote>
<div>Not a stupid question, an excellent one.&nbsp; First consider that while I am not a billionaire, I live in one of the most expensive areas of the country, and do quite well trading.&nbsp; As many in here know, I left a <i>very</i>&nbsp;lucrative industry and job to trade full time.&nbsp; However: 1) we aren’t perfect, there isn’t a 100% win rate, so there is risk, and with risk there is a limit to the amount of capital I will use, 2) I do increase my base amount by 15% every 6 months, but need to take the majority of the profits out to live off and to pay taxes, etc., 3) there is a limit to the size of trades – for example, there are only so many shares I can buy without eventually having to scale in, which runs counter to the immediacy of day trading, and we are not institutions, 4) but mainly – at least for me, <i>it is really hard</i>&nbsp;to hit the numbers I have to hit, hard to manage that many positions, if I were to increase my position sizes to that extent the stress and difficultly would climb – I took out 20 contracts on the COIN CDS for example, I believe it will be profitable, but if I had taken out 100, would have I closed it when COIN dipped below 290? Would have I been able to open other positions and be focused?&nbsp; That is why I gradually increase by a rate of 32% a year (15% every six months), which btw, grows my buying power by 4X that amount.<p></p>

                <div>I go back to that excellent article Zippy posted over the weekend – You can literally give people the absolute winning formula for beating the market, and most will still lose money. In fact, we see it here everyday – this method is not some intangible idea, it is tried and tested across many years, traders and countless trades. Those that implement it correctly are verifiably profitable, in a consistent manner, and of a magnitude one can live off – but most can not do it. Why?&nbsp; Because the mentality to takes to trade is actually opposite the mentality you live by every day.&nbsp; You want to buy low and sell high.&nbsp; I want to buy High and sell Higher.&nbsp; You see a discount when a stock you liked at 100 is now at 95, I see a stock I don’t want anymore.&nbsp; I like a stock better at 105 than at 100 – but that is a different mindset that we live with everyday – if you go to the store and something that was $10 yesterday is now $15, you wouldn’t buy it – neither would I, but the market is not a store – I want stocks that are more expensive today than yesterday.</div>

                <div>When I have a winning position I want to add to it, taking profits is not my first thought.&nbsp; But most traders add to their losing positions and take profits as quick as they can.&nbsp; Successful traders lean into their winners and back off their losers – I am ok losing, as long as it was a good trade, and I am ok letting a trade lose money as long as the thesis is correct.&nbsp; But I am <i>not</i>&nbsp;ok having my average loser be higher than my average winner.&nbsp; But that is exactly the case with most traders – even if they have the absolute correct strategy – they are always hoping their losers turn around, well past the point it is rational to do so, and they are always trying to take profits as quick as possible out of fear the market will take it away.</div>

They do everything right, and in practice they crush it – they can hit the ball out of the park, they can make every diving catch, they are technically perfect – but put them in front of a crowd, with a real game on the line, and they choke – They have the skills, they just don’t have the mindset.&nbsp; So remember – Pete and this community will give you the skills, you are literally getting the keys to the kingdom here – but the rest is up to you and your ability to implement the mindset above.</div>

                <div>Everyone complains about stops. We here this every single day. The first notion is that everyone ALWAYS had to catch every single tick in the move. Get over it. You will never sell the high of the day and you will never buy the low. The second thing is… ever consider taking profits? Set targets. If the stock stalls and the market it moving higher… get out. Thirdly you need to consider market conditions. Hey, we are above the 50-day MA and we had long green candles on a gap reversal… maybe I should give the trades a bit more room because the market looks strong today. These are my considerations and no… there is not a formula I use. When I exit a trade I don’t look back. I set an alert and if the stock pulls back and gives me another chance I will consider it.</div>

                <p><b>@Andreas</b>&nbsp;So after a nice day like this new traders will think… great. That was a very profitable day and I just have to repeat it tomorrow. They will come in the next day with high expectations and fail doing exactly the same thing and they do not know what went wrong. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MARKET. Today was the ultimate set-up. It was a down open after the market had showed strength last week. We got the gap down and that provided the perfect entry. Then we got the gap reversal and follow through for almost 3 hours. Most of the moves have been over in the first 90 minutes, but not today. You had an incredible tailwind and that is why the price action was more orderly and predictable. Tuesday will not be the same so do not treat it as a repeat of Monday. If we trade in a tight range you need to be more selective and take gains earlier.</p>

<div>Outcome bias is when you judge a decision based on the outcome. When you put on the trade, it made sense. When price staged a weak breakout and and failed to progress further after a couple more tries, you cut your loss. This is a GOOD trade. Someone posted a great link here recently about how successful traders know how to lose and I’ll post it again because it was fantastic: https://tradertom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/BEST-LOSER-WINS-1.pdf<p></p>

<div>this depends on your broker and the overall state of your portfolio. i believe typically they will leave them open unless it will create a margin call. but you can check with your specific broker<p></p>

                <div>Same as Dave here – I used Tradersync but there is not much difference between that and Tradervue, we both look at the same stats – the most important thing to do is to upload your trades every day and then label them for what set-up you took and what mistakes (if any) you made.&nbsp; My focus is on win rate, number of trades per day, and profit per trade.&nbsp; As long as all three of those are within the margin of error each month, I know I will hit my target $ amount.&nbsp; So any one day isn’t something that I really focus on.&nbsp; Obviously there are some days where everything goes great and you have a huge boost, and I will note that – but it is definitely the monthly numbers.&nbsp; Also as you can imagine – if the focus isn’t on the daily result, it definitely isn’t on any single trade.</div>

                <div>That makes sense.&nbsp; You’ve built in your risk management by using options.&nbsp; &nbsp;taking 1 lot over night for my small account could be very risky but trading it intraday not so much. And I was able to ease out of TSLA afterhours as it moved back up.&nbsp; &nbsp; I’ll always remember what happened to my concentrated position in AOL the morning the twin towers were hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>I am currently resetting my long term investments- I brought them to cash given the current environment. &nbsp;When the market finally settles, which could be in a week or a year from now, I’ll set up two accounts. &nbsp;One that has a diverse mix of stocks, from GOOGL to HD to PFE to OXY to WMT. &nbsp;Also ones that pay decent dividends as well. On those I’ll sell weekly covered calls with a delta of .1 to .05. &nbsp; In that account will also be the LEAP OTM SPY puts. &nbsp;In the other account it will be LEAP calls on stocks like GOOGL and HD and ADBE, and I will sell calls against those LEAPS every week. &nbsp;The third account is the Day Trading Account.</div>

                <div>So they’ll be income from the dividend which get reinvested. Income from the covered calls, income from the calls against the leaps and income from the Day Trading. &nbsp;All while the base stocks and LEAPS grow in value. &nbsp;Hence why I’m waiting for the market to settle and return bullish. But given the global environment that Pete references its impossible to know when that will be until we see it.</div>

Let’s also look for stocks that will announce in the next month. Let’s also look for stocks that are in a D1 compression (they have not moved yet).

                <p>&nbsp; In my prior life I used be a Corporate Lending Manager with one of the big four banks in Australia with responsibility for assessing and approving residential and commercial tower developments for mainly large corporate clients. These would be substantial developments that required enormous amount of work and pressure – a development could easily be over 150M+ and I would practically end up writing a damn book about it, covering every foreseeable risk for the bank, from market risk, industry risk, financial risk to such risks as contamination and environmental. This was exhaustive work and it all started to take a toll on me. In 2015 after returning from a 7-week holidays in USA, I took a one-year career break with the intention of becoming of a full time trader, a fact unbeknownst to my wife who always had the view that I would go back after de-stressing and re-charging my batteries. But deep down I knew I was done with the bank, and I had to make trading work to replace my salary. One of the reasons for taking this leap of faith was that by this time I got lucky on some resource stocks which were pure gambling plays akin to buying bitcoin in 2011 but no way near the incredible returns of bitcoin or some of the alt coins.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>As you know Australia is resource rich in every mineral type and the landscape here is littered with penny stocks and if you happened to hit the right one, as I did on a couple of occasions, the paydays are impressive. This emboldened me to take the jump because I had some buffer and some lasting power. In the beginning, as most new traders do, I gravitated towards momentum stocks and very quickly got taken to the cleaners suffering devastating losses. But like an addict looking for the next fix, I kept turning up for those same momentum plays hoping that they would go on those magical runs, as they sometimes do, but invariably I happened to be on the other side of those runs. And I would do options, most of the time ATM or slightly OTM which are classic newbie starting out plays. By the time my career break ended, I had cleaned out my IB account but was able to replenish it by selling some long-term stocks. I also at that time put in a lump sum reduction of 100k into my mortgage to appease my other half which exercise on my part was purely a defense mechanism to fend off arguments but also, and more importantly, to demonstrate to her that trading was working for me and that I will not be going back to the bank. This 100k to the mortgage was like 7 years of principal reduction so everyone was happy! So I formally resigned in 2016 and set out to make trading a career on the premise that I will provide the exact monthly salary I was earning at the bank. In 2017 and bit of 2018 I kept doing the same things and losing money.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>I specialized in letting my losses run and cutting my winners! I was getting good at that and perfected that to fine art, so much so that this strategy would assist in the clean out of my trading account again. My savings had dissipated by now and I was now drawing down on my long term stock portfolio every month and providing that as replacement salary and kept this charade going, so essentially taking money from my left pocket and putting that into my right pocket except that whilst the right pocket was funding our living costs, the left pocket had dwindled down and it was on it’s last legs. In 2018 our family suffered a tragedy that inexorably altered our lives. By this time my failure to make money was already bringing about depressive elements in my life which subsequently spiralled into serious depression as a result of this one particular event. When some drug eventually brought me back after weeks of treatment, I had to do a serious introspection of my precarious situation. Now the option of going back to the bank was taken off my hands by circumstance as I had to assume two roles now, although I had been mulling over that bank option for some time. But I was in my early 40’s at that time and I shuddered at the prospect of going back into the corporate world given the fragility of my mind. I shuddered at the prospect of Monday morning buzz meetings, Friday debriefs of the weeks performance, one on ones every month with your superiors, quarterly appraisals with your superiors, I shuddered at the prospect of boardroom meetings with large clients again and so on and so forth.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>I hated all that and knew without an iota of doubt that it would take me back into the dark place very quickly and this will have far reaching ramifications for my girls and it was thus incumbent upon me to ensure my emotional wellbeing was always maintained for their sake. Although the last three years was painful to say the least, at least I was the master of my own destiny and trading may after all, be an avenue to sustain me and my family, because by that time I was getting decent in some aspects of trading such as charts reading etc and thus the three “lost years” may not have been in vain if I can only find the magic sauce. Thus began my quest for the holy grail, which btw for newbies does not exist. The sooner this fact is inculcated in their psyche, and in their formative trading years, the better they will be in realizing that the need to put sheer hard work to make this work, and nothing else will work. I devoured youtube looking for trading related materials, tried this and that, even doing riskier plays like selling naked puts but when I had to take assignment on some high priced stocks and having to roll down on some plays for months just to avoid assignment thus having significant margin tied up for extended periods, and not being able to do anything else, I stopped doing that. At that time, I also had accumulated a number of no chance in hell biotech stocks hoping for breakeven exit but the bags were just getting heavier. I needed to latch onto something, some sort of inspiration and a validation to keep going even if it was based on false premise, and I needed to believe that it was possible to earn a living from day trading.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Then in Nov 2018, I think the most significant thing happened for me, I came across a trailer of Free Solo on Youtube and thus came across Alex Honnold and his incredible achievements. I became fascinated by his achievements, particularly his achievement in climbing El Cap in Yosemite without ropes and being the only person in the world to do that. New York Times describes it as “öne of the greatest athletic feats of any kind, ever”. Others may have a different view on this but for me that is the greatest individual feat in human history. I rank it above anything anyone has done before, Imagine the mental fortitude and physical prowess that is required from someone to be to clinging to a sheer vertical wall 700 meters above just by the tip of your fingers and toes knowing full well any wrong move will lead to certain death and he has to subdue his fear and physical pain for over 4 hours when he climbed El Cap. And he knows he has no option but to find a way to go up, he cannot go down! What an extra-ordinary psychological state of mind one needs to be in to be able to do that? He was asked on 60 Min how do you control the adrenaline rush and fear at that height because remember every step he takes he has to look down at his toe footings so he would be seeing the scary heights every step he takes and constantly doing that all the way to the top. He replied that there is no adrenaline rush because if there was any, it would suggest something has gone wrong and that would be a precursor to fear. Alex also said he practiced with a rope about 50 times over a number of years before he did that, and he mentioned that every year he would go to Yosemite and look up the wall and say this is the year he will make the attempt but he would back out because his mental and physical preparation just wasn’t there.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This is a very important point that resonated with me, here I was, and by extension many new traders, who want to jump into the lions den against the smartest and best funded traders in the world, with billions of dollars available in research funds and ability to manipulate and move stocks, without any proper physical training, which in our case could probably imply locking down a tried and tested strategy, and without any mental training, how ridiculous is that? I needed to evaluate everything about my trading and an introspection began and thus a hiatus from trading for a few months where I needed to train my mind and learn a strategy that will work. Firstly, I had to dispel from my mind any grand fantasies about driving into my driveway one day in a Lambo, or living by the sea. I had to get real because by now money had run out and I was dipping into my Superannuation Fund which, I may be wrong about this, is like your IRA or 402k?? not sure about this. In Australia we can create our own managed funds called SMSF (Self Managed Superannuation Fund) where you manage your own investments for retirement but for benefit of the fund and only available from age 60, and it is tightly regulated by the tax man, they really come down hard if you misuse funds for other purposes. After 3 years I started to understand my emotional make-up as to what strategy may be best to fully work on. Swinging positions have caused me enormous grief and I wanted to get away from that. Remember that your premarket market open at 4am is 6PM Sydney time with market opening 11.30pm.</p>

                <p>If ES is down significantly premarket, for 5 hours until the open, I would watch ES do it’s dance and know for sure that I am going start red on those bags I’ve been holding, So my physche was already shot to pieces even before the market opened and the trading day, for certain, will be one of managing further bleeding. No matter what I do, I will not have a positive mindset when I start trading especially when 10 tickers are staring at you in red at 11.30pm open. I would just look for ways to manage and stop further bleeding instead of looking for good trades which would be there because opportunities would be abound by virtue of the increased volatility caused by the large fall in futures. For this reason I used to hate ES/SPY because the health of my swing positions were dictated by the whims of these two. So with deep trepidation I decided to realize all my losses and these were significant, and get into cash 100%. I still had a little position left in resource lithium stocks which got a life as a result of all the EV craze, to re-fund my accounts. Whilst the liquidation action had the effect of clearing my account again, I oddly felt liberated and decided that going forward, I will start in cash and end in cash, any swing position will only be a minor part of the portfolio and these will mainly be cds and pds and if these positions crash and burn, they will have no impact on my portfolio or do any damage to my physche. Whilst at that time I had not come in contact with Pete’s catch phrase i.e market first market first, market first, I sort of decided that going forward, it will be market only, market only, market only! I will only trade SPY and scalp during the day and be in cash end of day. I started recording SPY 1 &amp; 5 charts side by side for the whole session and instead of wasting my time watching the idiot box with netflex or youtube, I would play and study the recordings for scalp opportunities throughout the day. At any point in time, I would have 3 months of SPY recording in one of my old laptops.</p>

                <p>. I needed to make half of my daily bank salary and that was good enough, for instance if I was earning say $500 a day at the bank, half of that $250 was good enough for me, which when divided by the 6.5hrs of trading session equating to only around $40 that I needed to scalp every hour and that would be easily achievable right? Easier said than done! but over time I started to achieve consistency because as you all know, the moves at the first hour or two and the close are more pronounced and there are plenty of opportunities to scalp only 0.20 on say 300 share size which easily covered my hourly requirement. Even during the compression chopfest period during lunch time, which I try to avoid there are opportunities to meet my hourly requirement and while all this may sound too simplistic, having a structured plan in place has assisted me in meeting my daily goals and some. I have the national geographic cover of Alex prominently pasted at my trading station in which he is standing at a ledge with no where to go but up, That picture was of his ascent of half dome in Yosemite without ropes and he said that during that climb he felt fear at one point which left him paralysed and unable to move. He had to find a way and he did in the end climb to the top but it left him unfulfilled and he was lucky to survive. He said that he never wanted to get that feeling again as he wanted to be a great climber, not a lucky climber. Sometimes when positions aren’t going to plan, I look at that picture and try to imagine the turmoil and fear he would be feeling at that time and how he was able to conquer that fear and still climb to the summit. Unlike us he had no choice whereas we have various choices to either stay in a position or take profits or cut your losses. He said he has worked really hard to train his mind to conquer fear and I think we need to become the Alex, to do the same and to control the fear that emanates when positions go against you. I am also getting better in letting go of FOMO. Because I am a scalper, I will sell into strength at the top of 1min candle and if the next 1min candle continues on it’s upward trajectory without me, I am fine with it as long as my goals have been achieved. In the past I would absolutely beat myself for missing the rest of the moves and having said that I cannot remember how many times I;ve given back substantial profits because of greed. In one instance I remember I was up about 16k on a gapper that came out with a catalyst. I got in premarket and when market opened, I was feeling on top of the world. Then it begins it’s retracement immediately around 10am– goes below ema8, I am still holding, goes below VWAP and I am still holding and it bleeds to death all day, and I get out with a loss. This was pure greed in play on my part. But it was also pure pump and dump in play as well.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Anyone who got in after 9.30am had very little chance of getting out without a loss, every small pop was met with a larger dump and classic manipulation was at play here. If I remember correctly it popped the previous day AH and already made substantial run then so I guess the bastards had no qualms about coming up with an offering the next day. The abject disillusionment I felt in letting go of 16k plus some of my own money permeated into everything I did in my interaction with my kids who only saw an angry man not a father for a couple a days. I never want to have that feeling again, I feel like I have done all the hard work on the emotional side and for me scalping has assisted in that process. I have seen so much red in my time that now, with a structured mental stop loss plan, I am able to take these losses like water off a duck’s back. I feel like I now have the armour to protect me from being wounded in battle which I have been so many times in the past although fear and greed are always lurking in the shadows and it’s a constant battle. I have ended up with a strategy that provides me with peace of mind, there is no hope element to it, either it works or it doesn’t in the seconds or minutes I am in it and have no qualms about taking a loss even if the daily justifies swinging the position. I see Hari and Dave routinely swing positions and make a killing on those stocks, but these red traders are cut from a different cloth, they are unique and we are so lucky to have them. I cant remember how many times in the past 6 months I’ve seen Hari make money on stocks that are hot today but drifts lower over few days but because of strong dailys and technicals remaining intact he would remain in the position. But what will an inexperienced and newbie do? They will bail at the first sign of deeper retracement because of fear, and which fear sometimes is accentuated by an under capitalized account that will preclude them from holding or swinging position even through the daily justifies doing that. Keep doing that on a regular basis, you destroy your account. As I said earlier, I start the day in cash and end the day that way, it works for me with a tiny position in swing such a AFRM the other day which I was able to farm back to health through some creative repair works which like everything else in trading sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t. But being in cash is liberating as you can do all these things by virtue of having an almost full allocation of capital available to you, something I wont be able to do if swinging a lot where I will have to liquidate positions to deploy capital elsewhere. I do acknowledge that swing trading can be highly profitable and has a place for many people. I also no longer hate ES/SPY anymore now ES could be down 50 pts for all I care, instead I will wait for the open with bated breath and look for the increased volatility with glee allowing me to hunt for short sets or long as the case may be. While I am a scalper thru and thru, and primarily scalp SPY on 1 minute chart, these trades go against what is taught in the chat and thus inappropriate to post them. I can post a lot of tickers which I don’t mainly trade for other traders to consider, but all these tickers have some element of relative strength and relative weakness in them by virtue to them either breaking out or breaking down, so by that definition some of the core underpinnings of Pete’s teaching are inherent in the tickers I post.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>I just don’t post rubbish, what is rubbish though is sometimes bombarding the chat with stocks which can be counterproductive and preclude traders from doing the due diligence. I believe It is imperative for new traders ‘to learn how to fish themselves and not blindly follow trades posted by someone other those from the featured traders who have a demonstrated track record of consistency. There are some exceptions though such as Shark, Aoodi,Fox and Zippy who I see as becoming red in no time from what ive seen over last 6 months. Remember that by the time a trade is posted, the actual move may be petering out especially if it’s a scalp – the poster of the trade might already be getting out while you getting in. But following trades that have rs and rw element will give greater chance of success and longer holding power because they are supported by other factors which are taught here such as heavy buying, technical breakthroughs, relative strength all underpinned by the amazing 1OP. The new traders’ also need to understand that momentum trading and scalping will almost certainly lead to death of most accounts but following the methods taught by Pete and the featured traders here will lead to long term success if the necessary pre-requisites are there, and these are passion, sheer hard work and mental fortitude. One of the keys is the ability to take heat in a dispassionate manner, when to take this heat and move on and do this day in day out. In that respect we need to become the Alex who can stand on a vertical wall at 700 meters without fear, personifies the calmness under pressure with a single-minded focus to reach the summit. We need to reach our summit in trading and while easier said than done, it is possible as demonstrated by Pete and the featured traders day in day out. Trading is hard, bloody hard and the high attrition rate in this field speaks for itself. It is also an equalizer because a person with the right mental temperament can excel in it when a highly educated person coming out of Harvard or Stanford may fail miserably. When I was in the bank I used to manage an Italian bloke who had no university degrees and he had various loans with us, and so I would do an annual review of his facilities when he provided his tax returns, every year he would consistently demonstrate gross earnings over 400k – 600k and all he was doing was selling premiums, so just goes to show that there are many strategies that can work for one if they work hard, have the desire and follow a structured path as shown by Pete I am sure that after reading my story, a new and developing trader will find many aspects that they shouldn’t do and if they do identify this, then I feel it was worthwhile telling my story Tamdak&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <div>Tamdak’s story resonated with me on a deeply personal level – as some of you know I grew up poor, living in a car poor, dirt poor, a “Snicker’s bar” was a huge deal for me and my siblings to split type of poor – you get the picture.&nbsp; And while I have done very well for myself, and I am far from that life now, it always stays with you.&nbsp; So when I started trading and started losing, and not just losing, but losing the type of money that my family wouldn’t see in years of my mother working 3 jobs, it hit me hard.&nbsp; But more than that, it is what Tamdak said – the idea that <i>people can do this</i>&nbsp;and yet <i>I couldn’t</i>. <b>That</b>&nbsp;is what kept me up at night, and kept me coming back.&nbsp; I wasn’t going to let this beat me, I wasn’t going to give up and admit that I just couldn’t do it.&nbsp; So I pushed through and studied, and learned, and got better – eventually finding my way here and then it really started to click.&nbsp; So on an emotional level I can completely relate to Tamdak’s journey – and that he did it as a single father, raising two girls on his own, makes it all that more impressive.&nbsp; That story not only tells you what type of Trader Tamdak is, but also what kind of person, and it is most certainly a person I want to know.</div>

                <div>If you are new to trading, the best advice I can give you is to trade one share at a time until you get your win rate &gt; 75%. I know that there will be a mountain of mistakes that you will make and if you are only trading 1 share at a time you will have a very slow bleed. At least you will be able to stay in the game for a long time and learn. To get to that 75% a lot of learning has to take place. You don’t need to read books about trading psychology and position sizing and options strategies. They are a waste of time until you can get that win rate up. Technical analysis, analyzing your own trades, learning how to read the tape, understanding market context/importance of the market, trying technical indicators… Those are the lessons you have to master first.</div>

                <div>Most skills in life you can work on and there is steady progress. You can see yourself getting better at it. That is not the case with trading. You can knock the cover off of the ball for months, even years and then everything turns to garbage. That is particularly true when you have a 12 year bull market rally and money printing that never ends. I will be that most of you have never traded a bear market or a dull market (like today) that lasts for a year.</div>

                <div>But what you will see is a pattern there – each time both QQQ and AMZN spend very little time underneath the SMA before bouncing back up – so while AMZN is bearish ,and if you look at the daily, the RS of AMZN is -2.91 – it would be very risky to attempt any Bearish spread on the ticker</div>

                <div>On my first one – 3280/3250/3220 – I have a $30 spread between the strikes, and paid a debit of $3.15.&nbsp; So you substract the debit from the spread ($30 – $3.15) and get your <i>max profit, </i>which in this case is $26.85 per contract – or to put another way, I am risking $315 to get $2,685, which is 8.5 to 1.&nbsp; On my second Butterfly for AMZN, which was 3200/3175/3150 I paid a debit of $1.15, which is $25-$1.15 for a <i>max profit&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;of $23.85.&nbsp; Or a 20.7 to 1 ratio</div>

                <div>@Hari, I have had some success legging out of butterflies at the max profit of the short position. When the volatility is high and the short position reaches max profit well in advance of expiration, there is no good reason to keep it open as it cannot become more profitable than its max. Closing the position means if the stock reverses you can achieve a very high profit off the long “wings” when you decide to close them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>With something like 21 to 1 odds, the question really becomes – is there a higher than 5% chance that AMZN finishes the week between 3182 and 3168?&nbsp; Because I can lose that trade 94% of the time, and still make money with the 6% it <i>does</i>&nbsp;come in.&nbsp; Given the ATR of AMZN, and it’s current bearish direction, coupled with the atypical SPY pattern we are seeing right now, I felt that there is a higher than 5% chance of that occurring.</div>

                <div>these relationships do not always hold and when they don’t it is indicative of something is about to change… there is indecision and that could have a basis in government policy / central bank agendas or a reaction to some exogenic event, like the pending outbreak of war, a pandemic or a 9/11.</div>

                <div>Also all the equity markets in the world dwarf the currency markets – the currency market is estimated to trade around $5 trillion a day, with most trading concentrated on a few major pairs like the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD and AUD/USD. The currency market volume dwarfs the dollar volume of all the world’s stock markets combined, which average roughly only $200 billion per day. So if something unusual is happening in the currency market, you get be sure the equity market will swiftly react.</div>

I think I misunderstood the calculator you put up on reddit that asked for your daily goal as what I should work to make each day because of what I had previously learnt and it resulted in me overtrading on a rather flat day like today.&nbsp;<p></p>

                <p><b>@olleh</b>&nbsp;let’s say I need to make $10K a month to live off trading.&nbsp; With the average month having 20 trading days in it.&nbsp; That is $500 a day.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now looking at your stats you see that you make on average 10 trades a day, so that is $50 per trade needed.&nbsp; But obviously not every trade is winner right?&nbsp; So looking further into your stats you find that you have a 60% winning percentage.&nbsp; &nbsp;So that means out of your 10 trades a day, you get 6 winners and 4 losers on average.&nbsp; &nbsp;So in that case you would need to make $150 per trade that you win, and lose $100 per trade that you don’t win.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ok, so now you have some parameters.&nbsp; Right off the bat you can see what happens if you had a 80% win percentage – you would only need to make $100 per trade, and be able to lose $150 per trade.&nbsp; Or you could make $75 per trade and lose $50 on the losers.&nbsp; &nbsp; MUCH more flexibility if you raise your win rate.&nbsp; OR you can raise the number of trades per day – if you average 15 per day with a 60% win rate, you win 9 and lose 6 and you would need to make $100 per win, and lose $66 per loss.&nbsp; So you have two things that can really impact it – your win rate and your average number of trades.</p>

                <div>this bearish 1OP cross needs to show this. 1. breakdown of compression low (close of red candle from 30 min ago). that red candle needs to have an immediate red candle after it. The risk here is that the dip is a head fake and that is VERY likely. The market is strong. The programs will try to flush out long traders and lure in shorts. Then they run it the other way</div>

                <div>right now bearish traders are so excited they are hyperventilating. … just one more little move lower and I am shorting. that is their mentality. they get short and then a green candle comes out of nowhere shattering their dreams. See how good this looks? it really looks like the market is crowning. this is not where you short. You need to see more of the move… more red candles&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

                <div>Without getting into the details, it is known that Gold leads grain prices by about 15 months, bond yields by 20-1/2 months, and it leads oil prices by just shy of 20 months. Yields react to inflation worries, and oil prices are a big part of those inflation worries. I do not know exactly why oil prices (and yields) react to gold price movements with this exact lag time amount.  But I have seen it working this way for years, and so at some point one realizes that there is enough data to accept a phenomenon, even if one cannot explain it. 20 months ago, gold prices were just starting upward out of a brief consolidation around the $1500 level, and went on to make a top above $2000 on August 6, 2020.  Counting forward by 19.8 months from then gets us to an ideal top due around April 2022 for oil prices. Now, one thing we should not do is look at the magnitude of gold’s price move, and use that to calculate a future oil price level.  The relationship just does not work that precisely, and the magnitudes can vary a lot.  This model gets the timing pretty good, most of the time, but the magnitudes can differ.  I have found, however, that if I get the timing right, the magnitudes will take care of themselves. We should all still get ready for higher oil prices lasting into spring of 2022. I for one will be focused on energy stocks and do not foresee a rotation out of the energy sector given the inflation backdrop.</div>

                <p>So basically this is 3 covered calls and 3 bull calls and I am not exposed at all, and funding the bull calls from the short calls and receiving a credit for doing that. if the stock moves thru the strikes by expiration, that $2 spread will translate to $4 gain which with the $3.40 received now get me close to break even or thereabouts on this trade. If it doesn’t I will rinse and repeat to further reduce cost basis.</p>

                <div>interesting repair strategy&nbsp; i know a lot of traders who use repair strategies but i am not one of them. I usually just take the loss and move on. Repairing can be time consuming and extend a trade out for months at times. Just my opinion</div>

                <div>Here’s my 0.02 cents – I’ve tried repair strategies in the past, and the cost is not only your time, but with the psychological negative associated with the reminder of constantly having to deal with a loss. For me, it’s better to keep the mind clean and maintain focus on the next trade 100%.

                <div>Credit is always the one thing that can spoil a market rally and it has the potential to turn into a long term sustained selling. This does not mean that you go out and buy long-term puts on SPY. There have been stories about ghost cities in China for 8 years and if you acted on that you are broke. Credit issues take time to manifest and when they hit the selling escalates quickly. Follow price and you will be able to identify the real sell-offs from a normal pullback. Long red stacked candles on a daily chart with little to no overlap work for day trading and long term trading. This herky-jerky drop lower could turn into something nasty, but so far this is not the price action that signals panic selling&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@Brian</b>&nbsp;– Section 1256 contracts vs other investments (SPY) which are treated as “ordinary income” — as Aang / Zander stated makes it a 60/40% split effectively –&gt; However, Tax treatment (while important) is not the overall goal — remember, if you don’t get the trade right you are losing money (just more/less depending on tax treatment…but you are still losing money).&nbsp; So, goal is win rate, understanding trading system…</p>

Longer term sellers (risk off Asset Mgrs) would be super anxious to hit any bid and the bounce never gains traction.

                <div>This bounce also tells me that any new low is likely to be a marginal new low. We have begin of month fund buying and that will lend support today. Given the price action off of the lod here is what I am looking for: Bearish 1OP cross. Not much of a drop and higher low double bottom. that would give us a nice 1OP bullish cross and a release upward.&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@Pete</b>&nbsp;I have struggled 2 days this week to make a profit in the /MES. On Wednesday, I know what I did wrong. I sized up my position too much for my risk, and I let it run hoping it would turn around rather than just taking the small loss and moving on. Today, I only traded 1 /MES (17 times total). Twice I let it run too long and was down $110 total. The other 15 trades were small wins or small losses, so I ended up down $78.75. What is the best advice you can think of that will help me turn this around? Today should have been an EASY green day.</p>

                <div>On Custom Search you first want to get your base search down – so let’s say you are looking for strong stocks that held up well during this downturn = So I will put in Relative Strength vs Spy on the Daily, Heavy Volume Today, Price &gt; Previous Day High, and Liquidity -2 to 15.&nbsp; Ok that give me about 50 stocks.&nbsp; So now I want to narrow it down.&nbsp; &nbsp;But first I save this search because it is my Base Bullish Search , the one I use to cast a wide net.</div>

                <div>So then I increase Heavy Volume up, because I want stocks that are not only strong in this weak environment but have higher than average volume, so I move Heavy Volume to 140 which is like 1.4 Relative Volume.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then I want stocks above their 50, 100, and 200 SMA’s on the daily.&nbsp; &nbsp;At this point I could choose to use HA continuation as a filter, or ADX, or the SMI, Trade Signal (New), etc (all of these are explained in the manual) – but keeping it simple for this example.&nbsp;</div>

                <div><b>@Roy&nbsp;</b>they are defined risk so Im prepared to let them go to 0. so position sizing is key, i will usually use no more than 0.25%-.5% of my account per tranche. they expand and move around and can show a negative balance ahead of expiration, important to know that its due to pace of movement not what will be the actual value on expiration day (which will be max 0 not negative). bear in mind there is a time-lock function of flies which is that the multi-bag profit potential is really only there on opex day, vs. a CDS PDS which will already show a nice profit once the directional move is made (but also carries more risk than a fly).</div>

                <div>For market analysis you need to master the daily chart. For that I use moving averages, trendlines, horizontal support and resistance, candlesticks and price action. It is important to know what the heck is going on in global markets. What are the driving forces (they change constantly). What are the economic/political/earnings headlines that could impact the market? This macro viewpoint is provided for you each day in my comments, but you should not rely on me. The first 1/3 of my eBook is dedicated to this.&nbsp;</div>

You sit back patiently and you watch other traders firing left and right and you feel like a complete fool for missing a great opportunity. That is the WRONG mentality. You were right not to short early. That was a super hard short on a gap and go move lower. You could have had your head handed to you along the way trading against a strong market uptrend.

                <p><b>@Abie</b>&nbsp;First question is about scalp vs longer term day trade. I addressed this in my Sun night video. There were stocks that have been weak for a long time on D1. I don’t like them on a swing basis and hence I do not like them for a longer term day trade. I will however scalp them for a quick gain because the volume is great and the stock is stacking candles. I know going in that I am NOT going to swing it if the stock goes south so I have to set passive targets and make sure I am out. Short squeezes, bullish explosions, super volatile stocks with choppy M5 charts (previous days) all fit into that scalp category for me</p>

                <p><b>@Abie</b>&nbsp;For me the light went off when I was trading for a proprietary firm (2003 – 2006). I would try to execute about 500 trades a day and I would get filled on about 200 of them. That really helped me hone my pattern recognition skills. There system stopped working and I was the only trader they had left because I was not a robot, I knew good set-ups from bad ones. The tough part was decoding my brain and figuring out what made it a good set-up so that I could code it.</p>

                <p><b>@Abie</b>&nbsp;Question #4. When you reach trader nirvana you trade when you want and you trade what you want. For me its not about making millions a year and trying to beat George Soros. Everyone strives to have a certain amount of money so that they can live the life they want and do the things they want. I have reached that in my life so my trading is not motivated by money. I still like to win (and I hate to lose) and I still like knowing that I have the skill set. My goal now is to share my system so that some of you can get there.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>i do convey these things, I just think many of you are half-watching and waiting for the big pay-off (trade). someone this morning asked what the legs of the TSLA trade are. really? I had the option chain up for a long time in the video and mentioned the strikes specifically. it is EXTREMELY exhausting to have to keep repeating myself. I am not addressing the vast majority of you, but for the few you really need to get your head in the game and take notes.</div>

                <div>it is important to learn the trading strategies. methods scans etc on your own, Asking for answers from someone else will not stay with you like the ones you self discover. The route is laid out for you here. Do the work yourself and you will know why this works. Asking for answers will just have you parroting a scan, strategy what ever you asked but you wont understand why to take it or why it works, This is hard work and there is no way around that</div>

                <div>I’m curious to see if anyone else has this issue and has worked through it: I seem to have a lot of problems psychologically going long when I trade, like I feel like it is imminent the stock will turn around against me and drop. This makes it hard to trade without fear and trust my risk management strategy. But when I trade the short side, I am much more pragmatic and am willing to sit back and let my trades work, because for some reason, I trust my trades a lot more on the short side and am willing to let my plan play out. This has made it where even if I attempt an equal amount of short and long trades, almost all my money is made on the short side. Do any of you also experience a mental block on only the short side or only the long side?&nbsp;</div>

Waiting to hear news on a job, or someone you like perhaps, etc.&nbsp; <i>We are psychologically predisposed to getting bad news</i>.&nbsp; It is why we are shocked when something good happens – we don’t believe it.&nbsp; The “other shoe has to drop”, right?&nbsp; Because life has kicked us in the teeth so many damn times, it would be a miracle if it didn’t fall apart, especially when things are finally going good.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>

                <div>Early in my trading career I thought I had to catch every move and milk every drop out of it or I was not “a good trader”. That is an insane amount of pressure to put on yourself and that mentality causes more problems than it solves. As I matured I realized that I don’t need to catch every move and I don’t need to milk it for every drop. Relax, pick your spots, be patient and set targets that are reasonable. Now I am much happier and I control my trading (not the other way around).&nbsp; BestBuy does not like me as much because I don’t have to replace a destroyed keyboards/mouse.</div>

                <div>For the last 15+ years I have always had an audience watching over my shoulder. That is an intense amount of pressure in addition to trading. There were days when I would force trades and then anguish. I stopped doing that a long time ago. There were days last year during the market free fall where I did not catch an entry on an insane drop. I thought, “Pete you are a complete idiot for not shorting that move.” The market would sell off the entire day and I could not bring myself to get short. In the last hour of trading I would patiently wait for the bounce to set up and I would nail it. I would make a fantastic profit waiting for the next set up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@mrroberts</b>&nbsp;not sure I recall?&nbsp; In general I meant that when someone experiences a large loss their instinct is usually to try and make it all back as quickly as possible. For example, if someone had a 50K account, and was doing well making 100-200 a trade perhaps. And then all of a sudden they made a bad decision and lost $15K.&nbsp; All of a sudden making 100-200 doesn’t seem like enough to them, so they try to make bigger plays to make up for the money they lost.&nbsp; It is a downward spiral that can get out of control.&nbsp; So even after a big loss it is about hitting singles, not homeruns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div>This is a slippery slope. When I started trading I made money hand over fist turning adverse day trades into swing trades and avoiding hard stops. I felt invincible. I developed no risk management habits and it led to unbelievable losses down the road. I bet anyone here who’s been trading a looong time likely had a similar experience. I won’t belabor the point here during trading hours, but if the intraday trend reverses against you and it was intended as a day trade, it makes far more sense to cut a loss than to average down or turn it into a swing trade.&nbsp;<p></p>

                <div>Guys I am going to say this and that will be it – you may notice that “Featured traders” are now talking less – posting less trades (look back – active day like today, how many trades do you see posted from Featured traders today?) or no trades at all, I myself didn’t post most of my trades today.&nbsp; That’s not how it is supposed to be, but that is what it is becoming unfortunately.&nbsp; In it’s ideal state – <b><i>this is a teaching chat room</i></b> – those names you see in Red who have mastered this are supposed to be teaching new traders how to trade.&nbsp; Those who have “got it” but have not yet mastered it are posting their trades and learning themselves.&nbsp; Over time as someone shows they have mastered this, they become a featured trader.&nbsp; But unfortunately, no matter how often we ask people to hold questions, any time we post a trade, there are a bunch of questions about it.&nbsp; Those are mixed in with a bunch of non-urgent questions as well.&nbsp; On top of that there are “competing” methods of trading being taught here, Which may work just fine for that trader, but it is <i>not</i>&nbsp;what we teach here.&nbsp; Which means we are now arguing those as well.&nbsp; So now unfortunately, like many other of the red names you see you, I am going to remain silent and leave all you to it, and trade for myself for awhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>It is really hard to find successful traders who are willing to share research and education. There is no incentive and it is a royal pain in the ass to answer questions and to post trade ideas because it is distracting. Who needs that aggravation? No one. That is what makes it so hard to learn how to trade. The “fakes” are teaching seminars at the Holiday Inn. If they were the real deal you would not know their name and you would never have heard of them. That said, you could cast me in the same light. I do daily videos, but I try to back my videos up with performance. No one else that I know tells you what to trade in the video and then reviews it during the next video. I would be lying if I told you that I could keep doing this indefinitely. I can’t and I am getting too old for this. That is why I formed this chat room. I hope to teach an army of traders who can carry the torch when I am no longer able to do this. We have a solid core of excellent traders and that number is growing. At any moment one or more of the Featured Traders will hit a breaking point. No one understands this better than me. If they need to take some time off – fantastic. There are no strings attached, I am simply honored to have them contribute in the first place and you are very lucky to have them.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>I answered&nbsp;<b>@Scissorz </b>question in PM. And&nbsp;<b>@Fox </b>is 100% right – names in black <i>should </i>be contributing.&nbsp; &nbsp;And that is also why each month we have one trader that is voted on as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;But to be blunt, our names are in red for a reason – we consistently make money, and thus, are here to help others reach that goal – that’s it, that is the only reason.&nbsp; Otherwise, the 6 of us could just sit in our own chat and discuss trade ideas.&nbsp; And there are other traders here like Fox, Shark, Aoodi, (I am sure I am forgetting some, if so please forgive me), who are excellent traders and whose trades add an amazing amount.&nbsp; However, it is hard to teach a method when we are arguing other methods, or answering questions that can wait, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is one thing to say after hours, “Hey, so I notice that you all tend to hold on to trades overnight if they turn against you, using a strong D1 as your guide.&nbsp; &nbsp;But how do new traders avoid getting trapped into bad trades they should have exited? Where is the fine line between dropping a trade and holding it?”&nbsp; <b>That</b>&nbsp;is a legitimate question to ask and has an easy answer to it.&nbsp; However, what we get is a version of, “Holding trades like that is causing new traders to lose money and they shouldn’t do it – here’s what they should do. xxyyyxxxzzz etc.”&nbsp; &nbsp;It is one thing to get “Hey, you went long on ZYC but it is currently showing a negative 10SI, I also like that ticker for long, but was hesitating because it didn’t have RS, what overcame that obstacle for you?”&nbsp; but what we get many times is, “Why would you go long on that stock, it looks weak to me!”&nbsp; &nbsp;And then mixed in with all that is a bunch of strange analysis I can’t make heads or tails of, and neither can the others I ask.&nbsp; &nbsp;We want concise questions, if they are urgent during trading hours, we will answer them, if they can wait, even better. And yes, all featured traders have the ability to delete someone’s comment if we thought it was a problem, we just aren’t using that because we would rather not.&nbsp; I want this to be the best chat room it can be and I can tell you it isn’t just me, and it isn’t just a “few” people – look back in chat – it used to be filled with Featured Traders posting their trades <i>all the time</i>&nbsp;– do you see that anymore? I don’t.&nbsp; And I want the room to get back to that.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>All will be good. Hari has been doing cartwheels to educate everyone and the amount of content he posts is unparalleled. He has been burning the candle at both ends and I hope he takes some time off before he burns out. He will find the joy and simplicity of just trading and he in time he will be back. He is a born educator.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>This is a great community and I want everyone to be able to post. Be respectful. I don’t want to mute anyone. I did mute the trial takers during market hours and that will help. They are a revolving door and the questions are endless. Many of them are support questions like, “how do I change a symbol in Option Stalker”?</div>

                <div>I’m in my second semester of pre-med and I have dissected some frogs, but I still do not get this open heart surgery thing. Could someone please help me understand it? What are the exact steps needed to repair a heart valve? Learning how to trade takes an incredible amount of effort. There is an incredible spectrum of experience for trial takers here. Some are just getting started and they have read a book on technical analysis. Others have been trading for years with marginal success (I say marginal success because they would not still be trying if they went bust). If the “easy steps” to getting the most out of 1Option do not make sense, <u>you have a lot of learning to do.</u> To try and explain open heart surgery to the student above is a giant waste of time. There are years of coursework and residency before the pieces fit together. Many pre-med students can’t hack it. For some reason the “gurus” advertising pool-side trading have convinced everyone that it is easy to make huge profits with little or no experience. It is simply not true. When you tell someone it will take 12 years of education to become a heart surgeon, they do not question it. Have you every met a true professional trader? Probably not. There is a reason for that, it is hard. If you work 60 hours a week currently – good. You have the work ethic you need to be successful. However, you have to find at least another 20 hours a week to dedicate to learning this skill. I spend 60 hours a week on (trading). In the last 15 years it has been closer to 80 hours a week when I was developing Option Stalker. If there are still a lot of “gaps”, you need to spend more time studying charts, reading and trading small size. Amazon has an incredible inventory of great books and you can read the reviews to see which ones fit your style. Read more, experiment more, trade for more years and get detailed with your trade logs (every single trade). <u>These are the steps needed to get better.</u> 1Option is ideal for those who are ready to perform surgery. The eBook, the video tutorials, the Option Stalker manual and the chat room will make perfect sense because the foundation is already there.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Good morning, I have a question with regards to exercising option contracts. VTNR &nbsp;If I don’t own any stock, but I have eight 7.5 put contracts (itm) that expire tomorrow. Can I buy 800 shares today at $6.50, and exercise options tomorrow? That would be leaving me with (for the example sake) a one dollar profit on 800 shares… Correct? Or am I missing something? Are usually trade options before expiration and haven’t exercised much. Thanks</div>

                <p><b>@Shark</b>&nbsp;That is correct. You can buy the stock and exercise your puts to sell the stock at $7.50. You would do that if the options are trading below parity (intrinsic value). For instance if the stock is trading $6.45 x $6.50 and the options are trading for $.90 x $1.10 it would make sense to do it. If you sold the puts outright you would get $,90 selling on the bid. If you bought the stock for $6.50 and exercised the $7.50 puts you would get $1.00 for that trade and pocket the extra $.10. If the options are bid for more than $1.00 they still have time premium and you would be better off selling the puts.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>Question for swing trades: In addition to a bullish 1D chart for the stock do you use 1OP to enter into swing trades or turn your daytrades into swings? I have seen people here mention swings but the market has been dropping past few days, so are swings only based on the stock action? What gives you the confidence that the trend will continue?</div>

                <p><b>@Xeqt</b>&nbsp;to add to petes comment when swinging in these conditions. For me, my trades are meant to be day trades but because of our system here alot of them run a good bit and give me no reason to exit so i end up swining them and in a soft market i look for the stock to have RS to market into close, look at the daily cande that it will be putting in and then take partial profits of the day trade and add insurance (sell call against out of the money) to the remainder for swing.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@lostHead</b>&nbsp;Start looking back at a stock’s price pattern before you enter. Super volatile stocks will lift off like a rocket and then settle back. If it never settles back… let it go. Do not chase. How would you know if it settles back?</p>

                <div>thanks Zippy &amp; Pete. So need to be careful about entries – I entered on consolidation after the green bar – had one green bar then it tested prev-day support. And look back to get the nature of the stock and price-action. Adding to the every growing checklist !!</div>

                <p><b>@lostHead</b>&nbsp;So the good news about those lift offs is that you know there are buyers. That sets up well for a future trade. What I like to do is to double click the low from a bar that is well off of the high and set an alert there. That way if the stock comes back down I can start watching it again for an entry.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>Question for swing trades: In addition to a bullish 1D chart for the stock do you use 1OP to enter into swing trades or turn your daytrades into swings? I have seen people here mention swings but the market has been dropping past few days, so are swings only based on the stock action? What gives you the confidence that the trend will continue?</div>

                <p><b>@Xeqt</b>&nbsp;to add to petes comment when swinging in these conditions. For me, my trades are meant to be day trades but because of our system here alot of them run a good bit and give me no reason to exit so i end up swining them and in a soft market i look for the stock to have RS to market into close, look at the daily cande that it will be putting in and then take partial profits of the day trade and add insurance (sell call against out of the money) to the remainder for swing.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@lostHead</b>&nbsp;Start looking back at a stock’s price pattern before you enter. Super volatile stocks will lift off like a rocket and then settle back. If it never settles back… let it go. Do not chase. How would you know if it settles back?</p>

                <div>thanks Zippy &amp; Pete. So need to be careful about entries – I entered on consolidation after the green bar – had one green bar then it tested prev-day support. And look back to get the nature of the stock and price-action. Adding to the every growing checklist !!</div>

                <p><b>@lostHead</b>&nbsp;So the good news about those lift offs is that you know there are buyers. That sets up well for a future trade. What I like to do is to double click the low from a bar that is well off of the high and set an alert there. That way if the stock comes back down I can start watching it again for an entry.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>@Pete Hi, I’m new here (on the 2 week trial), and so I’m wondering what you think is the best way for me to be successful (during the next week and half) to truly see what you are offering. A simple time-line may help me understand. e.g. “Get online by XX:XXAM, check the app for the morning update, watch the latest video,…” etc. I know everyone is different, but if you had your ‘ideal client’ – what would they do each day to get ready to trade with you?</div>

                <div><b>@Pete</b> Great answers. I appreciate the honesty. I know I am definitely new to this, and have a lot to learn. I will look into everything you are offering. While I have only been seriously trading since May/June, I’ve been learning a lot of the basics for over a year- and I feel like I have a good grasp of many of the fundamentals. What I’m looking for now is to be in a group of successful traders to confirm a lot of what I’m seeing out there, and to be more consistent in my trades.</div>

                <div>There are many traders with lots of experience who have all of the basics, but they do not have a systematic approach. Those who have been marginally successful for a couple of years can learn this quickly and knock the cover off the ball.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>&nbsp;To Pete’s point I literally have completely paused my study of options just to focus on the stock because when you are learning a system, not just the system taught here but also the adaptation of that which works for you, it is much easier to do risk management with low amounts of shares. Like many of the features traders have pointed out, once you master this system and have reproduceable and scalable results, then options are the icing on the cake. When you start to scale up your risk, options are a nice way to make money IF you have the stock selection right to begin with based on RS/RW. Just my 2 cents.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>If we identify a stock with RS to long on a day like yesterday (market falling and 1OP is giving a bearish signal), is the system here recommending we stay out until we get confirmation from SPY and 1OP that a bullish trend approaches? I only ask because I have noticed many RS stocks make a large part of their move early on in the day and you get smaller jumps later on in the day. Also sometimes when 1OP is bullish the RS stock may not have a great entry point, so do we just enter anyway? Thank you for the help!</div>

                <p><b>@Xeqt</b>&nbsp;Good question. Because everyday is different and because I can’t go through every possible scenario i am going to answer as if the market has been week for days and there is a bearish gap reversal on the open. In my opinion you do not want to stick your head into the noose when the market downtrend is strong – NO MATTER HOW STRONG THE STOCK IS</p>

                <div>@Pete Hi, I’m new here (on the 2 week trial), and so I’m wondering what you think is the best way for me to be successful (during the next week and half) to truly see what you are offering. A simple time-line may help me understand. e.g. “Get online by XX:XXAM, check the app for the morning update, watch the latest video,…” etc. I know everyone is different, but if you had your ‘ideal client’ – what would they do each day to get ready to trade with you?</div>

                <div><b>@Pete</b> Great answers. I appreciate the honesty. I know I am definitely new to this, and have a lot to learn. I will look into everything you are offering. While I have only been seriously trading since May/June, I’ve been learning a lot of the basics for over a year- and I feel like I have a good grasp of many of the fundamentals. What I’m looking for now is to be in a group of successful traders to confirm a lot of what I’m seeing out there, and to be more consistent in my trades.</div>

                <div>There are many traders with lots of experience who have all of the basics, but they do not have a systematic approach. Those who have been marginally successful for a couple of years can learn this quickly and knock the cover off the ball.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>&nbsp;To Pete’s point I literally have completely paused my study of options just to focus on the stock because when you are learning a system, not just the system taught here but also the adaptation of that which works for you, it is much easier to do risk management with low amounts of shares. Like many of the features traders have pointed out, once you master this system and have reproduceable and scalable results, then options are the icing on the cake. When you start to scale up your risk, options are a nice way to make money IF you have the stock selection right to begin with based on RS/RW. Just my 2 cents.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>If we identify a stock with RS to long on a day like yesterday (market falling and 1OP is giving a bearish signal), is the system here recommending we stay out until we get confirmation from SPY and 1OP that a bullish trend approaches? I only ask because I have noticed many RS stocks make a large part of their move early on in the day and you get smaller jumps later on in the day. Also sometimes when 1OP is bullish the RS stock may not have a great entry point, so do we just enter anyway? Thank you for the help!</div>

Because everyday is different and because I can’t go through every possible scenario i am going to answer as if the market has been week for days and there is a bearish gap reversal on the open. In my opinion you do not want to stick your head into the noose when the market downtrend is strong – NO MATTER HOW STRONG THE STOCK IS</p>

                <div>What I do is not easy. It has taken me years to learn how to trade in this fashion. Patience is the key. When most traders “size up” it is the kiss of death. Your emotions get the better of you because you have a lot at stake.&nbsp;</div>

That does not mean that I trade that news, but I am certainly aware of it. When VIX is at historic lows and the forward P/E on the S&amp;P 500 has not been this high since the 2000 tech bubble I take notice. That means I don’t swing long term.

                <div>Based on the questions I see asked – here’s my advice – be less concerned about the entry and exit – and more concerned about getting the market right and the stock right – if you do those two things, as Pete says, you will be fine – So much focus on exactly why one exited or where the exit should be – I know that is what you were taught when learning trading – but unlearn it – that comes second – market – then stock – comes first.&nbsp; At that point, entry and exit is more about <i>how</i>&nbsp;much profit.</div>

                <div>ie – there are (at least) these two ways I can see to read the active trader:</div>
<div>1. Looking at the past volume at the different prices I can see how much supply/demand there was at the current level, then based on how the price is moving I project how many bagholders/buyers there might be…?</div>
<div>2. Looking at the bid/ask offers out there and seeing how quickly they’re satisfied I project how the price is going to move.</div>

                <div>If you are talking AH, then you’re overcomplicating it.&nbsp; AH tends to work like this – the first hour – a set of around 10-20 stocks have the most volume and are moving higher – some are because of a catalyst (like earnings), some are from the momentum carried over from the regular market day, and some because of low float.&nbsp; They tend to reach a peak and then either stabilize or pullback.&nbsp; At this point there are the following types of stocks : 1) They begin to drift lower on very little volume until close, with the occasional headfake, 2) They drop quickly reaching a price point of AH support and then stay there with almost no movement, 3) They begin another leg higher with moments of plateau and jumps in volume, 4) They look dead, and then suddenly for no apparent reason begin to get jolts of volume and jump back up again.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Based on the questions I see asked – here’s my advice – be less concerned about the entry and exit – and more concerned about getting the market right and the stock right – if you do those two things, as Pete says, you will be fine – So much focus on exactly why one exited or where the exit should be – I know that is what you were taught when learning trading – but unlearn it – that comes second – market – then stock – comes first.&nbsp; At that point, entry and exit is more about <i>how</i>&nbsp;much profit.</div>

                <div>ie – there are (at least) these two ways I can see to read the active trader:</div>
<div>1. Looking at the past volume at the different prices I can see how much supply/demand there was at the current level, then based on how the price is moving I project how many bagholders/buyers there might be…?</div>
<div>2. Looking at the bid/ask offers out there and seeing how quickly they’re satisfied I project how the price is going to move.</div>

                <div>If you are talking AH, then you’re overcomplicating it.&nbsp; AH tends to work like this – the first hour – a set of around 10-20 stocks have the most volume and are moving higher – some are because of a catalyst (like earnings), some are from the momentum carried over from the regular market day, and some because of low float.&nbsp; They tend to reach a peak and then either stabilize or pullback.&nbsp; At this point there are the following types of stocks : 1) They begin to drift lower on very little volume until close, with the occasional headfake, 2) They drop quickly reaching a price point of AH support and then stay there with almost no movement, 3) They begin another leg higher with moments of plateau and jumps in volume, 4) They look dead, and then suddenly for no apparent reason begin to get jolts of volume and jump back up again.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>Best not to think. Trade what is in front of you. I am shocked that all of this money printing has gone uncontested for years. If I traded what I thought I would be broke.<p></p>

                <div>You know from my comments that I try to be aware of all of the variables that could drive the market fundamentally. That does not mean that I trade that news, but I am certainly aware of it. When VIX is at historic lows and the forward P/E on the S&amp;P 500 has not been this high since the 2000 tech bubble I take notice. That means I don’t swing long term.

                <div>Based on the questions I see asked – here’s my advice – be less concerned about the entry and exit – and more concerned about getting the market right and the stock right – if you do those two things, as Pete says, you will be fine – So much focus on exactly why one exited or where the exit should be – I know that is what you were taught when learning trading – but unlearn it – that comes second – market – then stock – comes first.&nbsp; At that point, entry and exit is more about <i>how</i>&nbsp;much profit.</div>

                <div>ie – there are (at least) these two ways I can see to read the active trader:</div>
<div>1. Looking at the past volume at the different prices I can see how much supply/demand there was at the current level, then based on how the price is moving I project how many bagholders/buyers there might be…?</div>
<div>2. Looking at the bid/ask offers out there and seeing how quickly they’re satisfied I project how the price is going to move.</div>
<div>3. …?</div>

                <div>If you are talking AH, then you’re overcomplicating it.&nbsp; AH tends to work like this – the first hour – a set of around 10-20 stocks have the most volume and are moving higher – some are because of a catalyst (like earnings), some are from the momentum carried over from the regular market day, and some because of low float.&nbsp; They tend to reach a peak and then either stabilize or pullback.&nbsp; At this point there are the following types of stocks : 1) They begin to drift lower on very little volume until close, with the occasional headfake, 2) They drop quickly reaching a price point of AH support and then stay there with almost no movement, 3) They begin another leg higher with moments of plateau and jumps in volume, 4) They look dead, and then suddenly for no apparent reason begin to get jolts of volume and jump back up again.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Hello. Had a question come up as I’ve been learning risk management. Why would someone use a mental stop loss? If I have a $100 risk on a trade, my stop loss would have to be defined to determine position size. Wouldn’t relying on manual exits result in greater losses/bag holding due to emotions/human delay? I do see an upside as it saves you from getting bid checked and flushed out but struggling to understand how the mental stops are calculated and how risk management would work in that regard. Do you just not use R:R even with win rate taken into account? Thanks!</div>

                <div>Hello. Had a question come up as I’ve been learning risk management. Why would someone use a mental stop loss? If I have a $100 risk on a trade, my stop loss would have to be defined to determine position size. Wouldn’t relying on manual exits result in greater losses/bag holding due to emotions/human delay? I do see an upside as it saves you from getting bid checked and flushed out but struggling to understand how the mental stops are calculated and how risk management would work in that regard. Do you just not use R:R even with win rate taken into account? Thanks!</div>

                <p><b>@Xeqt</b>&nbsp;I do not use R:R and never have – my exits are determined by the charts, not by some predetermined level of financial pain I am willing to risk.&nbsp; And those charts are dynamic and changing – thus, my exits change with it – the market also looms over every trade, and impacts my decisions as well.&nbsp; I need to have the flexibility that hard stops to do not allow for, but more importantly hard stops focus one’s trading on their P&amp;L and not trading your P&amp;L is one of the most important steps to becoming a successful trader.</p>

                <div>Position sizing based on how far a potential stop might be is always good. &nbsp;But rigid stops when the market is dynamic is more about self-control than solid technical trading. &nbsp;On Friday both GOOGL (the first trade) and AMZN moved beyond where the typical stops would be on a short, however my trade was based on Relative Weakness and at the very least a retest of the low on SPY, so I held both – when SPY fell both stocks crashed down and I took profit. &nbsp;An unmovable hard stop would have turned both those trades into losers. &nbsp;</div>

                <div>IRNT and ATER both fell way below several points where one would have hard stops. &nbsp;However both drops were on low volume, something you wouldn’t know when putting the stops down.

                <div>There are many ways you can approach the market. 1. You can ignore the market backdrop and swing overnight longs with the notion that the money you make on the way up will more than offset the time you get wacked (this approach has worked if you started early in the year you are way up). 2. You can reduce your overnights and focus more on day trading. This allows you to have max flexibility and this is my preferred choice. 3. You can carry a mix of longs and shorts with rel str/rel weakness. 4. You can hedge using SPY/ES/VIX. The amount of protection you seek is a personal choice. A perfect hedge will cost between 5-7% for 6 months. From my experience, most people who run the numbers never put the hedge on so I do not like talking about it. It is a giant waste of time for me. If you were going to hedge, I believe that protection against a 10% move&nbsp; is more than enough and it should not be a perfect hedge for that first 10% because the upward bias is so strong. The dips have been brief and shallow. In the absence of a credit crisis, the market will not plunge. If there are signs of a credit crisis I will be shorting.</div>

You can ignore the market backdrop and swing overnight longs with the notion that the money you make on the way up will more than offset the time you get wacked (this approach has worked if you started early in the year you are way up). 2. You can reduce your overnights and focus more on day trading. This allows you to have max flexibility and this is my preferred choice. 3. You can carry a mix of longs and shorts with rel str/rel weakness. 4. You can hedge using SPY/ES/VIX. The amount of protection you seek is a personal choice. A perfect hedge will cost between 5-7% for 6 months. From my experience, most people who run the numbers never put the hedge on so I do not like talking about it. It is a giant waste of time for me. If you were going to hedge, I believe that protection against a 10% move&nbsp; is more than enough and it should not be a perfect hedge for that first 10% because the upward bias is so strong. The dips have been brief and shallow. In the absence of a credit crisis, the market will not plunge. If there are signs of a credit crisis I will be shorting.</div>

<div>There is also confirmation bias and law of small numbers, which means people will likely find evidence for what they are looking for. So, it goes back to trading technicals and what the chart tells you, not what you hope or theorize what the stock will do. It ends up being a crapshoot!<p></p>

<div>There is also confirmation bias and law of small numbers, which means people will likely find evidence for what they are looking for. So, it goes back to trading technicals and what the chart tells you, not what you hope or theorize what the stock will do. It ends up being a crapshoot!<p></p>

<div>There is also confirmation bias and law of small numbers, which means people will likely find evidence for what they are looking for. So, it goes back to trading technicals and what the chart tells you, not what you hope or theorize what the stock will do. It ends up being a crapshoot!<p></p>

                <p><b>@PepeLePew</b>&nbsp;I scan for potential stocks to trade the night before, looking for daily charts that present a potential continuation of a trend or from a breakout of breakdown. I put them on a watchlist and sort it just after the open to see if any of them are continuing. If some are they become good prospects for day trades since they had a strong daily chart as well. Pre market&nbsp; i look for stocks with larger volume than normal, these stocks are generating some buyers or sellers and need to be watched for a day trade</p>

                <p><b>@PepeLePew</b>&nbsp;I scan for potential stocks to trade the night before, looking for daily charts that present a potential continuation of a trend or from a breakout of breakdown. I put them on a watchlist and sort it just after the open to see if any of them are continuing. If some are they become good prospects for day trades since they had a strong daily chart as well. Pre market&nbsp; i look for stocks with larger volume than normal, these stocks are generating some buyers or sellers and need to be watched for a day trade</p>

                <p>Example on MRNA m30 entry. Daily in bull flag, with catalyst news on producing antibodies (not huge news imo, but good) re circle- bullish engulfing pattern of the pdc and stacks another green on volume through a daily level (red line) My play was on the flag set up. with daily level (red line and pm hod as support) Entry on cds was approx the white dot, stop loss orange dot, tgts green dots. I played it exactly as i would with m5 but on m30. Will continue to experiment with this.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>Apparently, according to Ameritrade, the Fed wanted to restrict Day Trading, and so they removed the ability to wait 90 days and day trade again, or to have the 3 Day trades every 5 days – they basically want it either – you have over 25K and can day trade, or you don’t and thus you have to have a cash-settled account.&nbsp; No in-between.&nbsp; This was because there were millions of day trades on MEME stocks which they claim created to much volatility, so in order to “protect” people they put in these new restrictions.</div>

                <div>A note I mentioned to people on Reddit – do not put so much reliance in what you think other retail traders are going to do, remember <i>retail traders very rarely move the market</i>.&nbsp; For example, someone was saying, “They are releasing more shares tomorrow, so the price should go down.”&nbsp; That is information that institutions have had for much longer than any retail trader has, and have already acted on it.&nbsp; What matters is what institutions are going to do, and whatever you think should have <i>today</i>, they have already priced in a long time ago.&nbsp; They have more information and have it sooner.&nbsp; What we have is the indicators they use to make decisions (technical analysis), we have the market, and we have stocks that are stock or weak against the market.&nbsp; That allows us to follow the smart money and get those breadcrumbs along the way.&nbsp; But if you spend your time trying to figure out what other retail traders will do, not only are you wasting your time, you are also over-estimating (by a lot) how much that matters – it doesn’t (except in rare cases, like <b>GME</b>&nbsp;where retails traders acting en masse on a stock that was over-shorted.)</div>

                <p><b>@Hariseldon</b>&nbsp;<b>@Dave W </b>Im pretty sure I asked one of you this before but I cant find or remember the answer so I was hoping to ask again. I know the basic % profit targets on the CDS for each day. Do those apply for only CDS day trades or do you bump your profit level up each day that passes. Say I buy on Monday and like the trade or for whatever reason am still in it come Friday. Can I look for up to a 40%+ gain or does that only apply if I bought the CDS same day Friday?</p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;It is just a guide based on the average amount of movement you can expect from a CDS on those days.&nbsp; The closer you get the expiration the easier it is to take a larger percentage of profit without a huge move in the underlying stock.&nbsp; So if you bought it on Monday and can get 40% for it, great, take it!&nbsp; But if you bought it on Monday and still have it come Thursday, your decision entirely depends at that point on the stock itself and the market.&nbsp; If your CDS was underwater all week, and come Thursday it finally is in profit, but the market is weak, you might want to just exit right then.&nbsp; If on the other hand it is finally in profit and the market and stock are strong, and look to finally be doing what you expected it to do, then you can expect that CDS to go into higher levels of profit easier on that Thursday than if it were a Tuesday (for example).</p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;the profit to plan for increases as you get closer to expiration regardless of when you placed the cds. First when a cds is carried overnight or more the first thing to check is the technicals and make sure the trade is still bullsih and with striking distance of your long option. If it still has technicals similar to what they were when you entered then you can generally raise your price target each day as you approach expiration</p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;looking at the option pricing the market seems to be expecting an +/- 8% move before 12/31.&nbsp; So what I wanted to do is hedge some of my portfolio against a downside move of 8%.&nbsp; By doing a Put Debit Spread of 447/416 for $8 debit on Dec. 31, perfectly accounts for just that – so I sized it to be roughly 15% of the portfolio, and it gives me some cover (not complete) but some cover on that downside risk – particularly since I am usually carrying long positions over night (given the market the positions are typically 80-90% bullish) .&nbsp; Hope that makes sense!</p>

                <div>The 8% move is calculated by looking at the ATM option pricing of the Call and Put, you can see by the pricing the expect movement in the underlying.&nbsp; As for the portfolio I am basing it on the average, typically I am 50% in cash, 50% in positions, and those positions are usually 85% bullish – hence this hedge covers roughly 25% of those positions at any given time.</div>

                <div>There are a number of ways to hedge. 1. Buy protective puts (or put spread on SPY) 2. Find stocks with relative weakness and take short positions (short stock or buy puts/put spreads) 3. Short futures 4. Reduce long positions and longer term exposure (cash). 5. Buy VIX or calls on VIX. As a short term trader I prefer to reduce my swing positions when I feel that risk is elevated and I focus more on day trading.

<div>synthetic covered call (pmcc is not the standard name for it) is more bullish in nature than the put credit spread. Any time you are short premium, part of the deal is also that you are going to pass some time also. So a large early move will not pay you in a pcs until at least some time has passed. The profit is coming mainly from theta decay, with a bit of delta boost from directional move in your favour. For long options like with a synthetic covered call you are getting paid from delta move in your direction, with the short option potentially gaining from theta as long as not breached before expiration.<p></p>

                <p>In my previous posts I have mentioned the importance of market analysis and context. How does the current market move fit into the longer term picture? Knowing this puzzle piece will help you plan your trading day before the open.  </p>
<div>Let’s say that the S&amp;P 500 is up 30 points before the open. Everything is flying and it looks like the action is going to be hot. The problem with buying an opening gap higher is that we do not know if profit taking will lead to a gap reversal or if buyers are so aggressive that the opening price will also be the low of the day.   </div>
<div>Currently the market momentum is very strong and the pattern on a daily chart can be described as a gradual drift higher with brief dips and snap back rallies that lead to a new high. After these drops and bounces the market falls back into the drift higher. The candles compress and there are many doji formations (closing price is equal to the opening price).  </div>
<div>If the market has dropped to the 50-day MA and it has found support the next day we often see an overnight gap up. Many of those have resulted in “Gap and Go” days. Buyers are aggressive now that support has been confirmed and they are anxious to join the longer term market uptrend. You can be more aggressive with your buys in this scenario. In the chart you can see how even on these days most of these candles still have a tail under body so there is a chance to get in better than the opening. </div>
<div>If the market is gapping up to a new all-time high you have to be careful. That move will excite bullish speculators and they will load up on the open. In the first 30 minutes we often see profit taking and those buyers are trapped (“Gap and Gag”). They are going to choke on their longs and they will accelerate the reversal as they bail on their trades. Also know that if the market had a “Gap and Go” to a new all-time high the previous day, know that a second “Gap and Go” is less likely. </div>

                </div>
                <p>If the market gaps up and it is in the middle of the 20-day range, look at previous candles. Chances are you will see candlesticks that have tails under the body. That tells you that you are likely to see a price during the day that is lower than the opening price and you will have a chance to buy. You do not have to chase.  </p>
<div>It is always best to error on the side of caution when you are trading in the first 30-45 minutes of the day (even if there is no gap). You don’t know what the market is going to do. When you have a gap up you also have a lot of “fakes”. All ships rise with the tide and some of these stocks will reverse easily. After 30-45 minutes you can identify stocks with relative strength and you have a much better sense for market direction/momentum.  </div>

                <div>If you determined that the stock has an easy $2 move given market conditions and the price action of the stock is consistent with that target you can use the $1 target for the options with a .5 delta. While you have the position on, constantly monitor the market and the price movement of the stock. Sometimes you might have to adjust your target down and sometimes you might be able to get more. Instead of having an all or none approach, scale in and scale out of positions.&nbsp;</div>

They are simply too rigid and each stock and every market day is different. Your brain is still the most powerful computer in the world and it can adjust and adapt every day. The good news is that I am still here manually trading and teaching each day. If I had a system that worked as well as my brain, this chat room might not be around.</div>

                <div>There is a difference between a losing trade and a bad trade. A losing trade you go through the decision making process and you execute accordingly. Unfortunately the trade does not work out. A bad trade is where you bend the rules to fit the stock and you ignore potential warning signs/market conditions. Sometimes you can make money on a bad trade and that is the kiss of death because it reinforces bad habits. Most of the time you will lose on a bad trade</div>

                <div>When you are “bored” or the market is slow, most people will tend&nbsp; to chase a trade just to try to make something happen. However, that is the mindset of a gambler. More times than not you will end up losing. a disciplined trader knows he wont win every trade, and also knows that market conditions wont be ideal every day. When you get that feeling or itch to make something step away, there will be better set ups, save your powder.&nbsp; Once you are able to do that, you will become a much better trader.&nbsp; Only disciplined people make it, the rest are just gamblers that get lucky.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Here is the issue with determining “how you found trading in a bear market”, you dont know you are in a bear market until it has been ongoing for a while so it is identified in retrospect. If you trade relative strength and relative weakness stocks in the direction of their trend using the daily chart as your starting point for a trade you wont get trapped trying to catch bottoms or tops. There will be more opportunities for short trades when you are in a bear market since more charts will become bearish but trading wise i dont find much difference other than you will be trading bearish strategies more (call credit spreads, put debit spreads, long puts etc)&nbsp;</div>

<div>youll be correcting that for a looong time. its unavoidable the relation between what you seen on the charts and the meaning behind the profits you stand to make/lose. you cut them early because you want to keep real $ gains that’s totally human. just takes more screen time to dissociate the market-generated-infmation and what is relevant inside your mind’s fears/desires etc. then just when you have the hang of it, you will up your size and start all over.&nbsp;<p></p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;i was in the same boat as you, run at the first sign of a red candle, this may not be for most people but what is helping me is changing to HA charts for my exits, not all but some of my exits. There is less “red” there and this allows me to hold trades longer as long as technicals holds up. For instance today I was able to take $9.90 in NFLX by holding it from 10.10am to 12.06pm.&nbsp; If I was looking at candles, which on a 1 min chart had about 64 red candles between 9.30 – 12.00am, as compared to about 31 reds on HA charts, I would have been freaked out pretty early and would have bailed well before 12.06.&nbsp; Give it a shot and see if it works for you</p>

                <div>thanks Dave – The differences I think are in 1. Wider spread will take one of the legs further out from ATM and, 2.Commission for the options. Not too sure how time-decay and delta varies with wider spread vs narrower spread</div>

                <div>the greeks dont matter to me on credit spreads. The only consideration for 5 contracts vs 1 contract is the commissions. A lot of traders take credit spreads by using the delta of the short and long puts, to me the critical components is having your support levels defined clearly so you sell you put as far below those levels as possible and still receive your 25+% credit. You can get down in the weeds on options greeks and make it much too complicated</div>

                <div>You are not alone. Every new trader feels like they have to pick the perfect entry and exit. The sooner you get over that notion, the better. Scale in and if the trade is working out, add to it. The same will be true on the exit. You will rarely sell the high. Our goal is to ride the trade as long as possible and to take a piece out of the move consistently. HA plotting will help you do that because it reduces the noise.</div>

It dictates our trading during the day and it will help you when you trade futures. 2. There is <u><b>NO</b></u> edge to trading S&amp;P. When you have a buy signal on S&amp;P you trade stocks with relative strength. If your entry is a little off and the market continues to slide, these stocks will hold up well. You can exit the stock with little or no loss or you can weather the market dip knowing that the bottom is close. This is our trading system in a nut shell and you should spend as much time as possible learning 1OP and the searches that help you identify relative strength</p>

                <div>So when it comes to trading programs they draw these trendlines programmatically (algo lines). There is a good chance that if we poke thru it will attract sellers (that is what I would use as a trigger). often that breakdown triggers sell stops as well. The key is to watch what happens after that. If the market bounces right away it was a head fake. Given that 1OP is far into bear cycle that is what I would expect. If the breakdown has follow thru on the next bar it is legit</div>

Using the closest date to have the put sold be more susceptible to time decay. That way the put that is purchased in the spread would end up being more valuable in this hence where the profit comes in. Do I have the right idea here?&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Remember – much of the trading issues people have – outside technical analysis issues – in terms of mindset can be traced back to a very basic human condition – we all have a tendency to exit our winners too quickly because we have learned in life that the other shoe always drops – so our mindset is to <i>take profits fast</i>, and we equally and ironically have a tendency to believe our losers will “turn around”, because we are inclined to root for the underdog and always think our “luck will change”.&nbsp; This leads to the illogical stance of having more faith in our losers than we do our winners.&nbsp; Solving this mindset issue is a HUGE overcome for traders, even experienced ones.</div>

I’m trying to learn from your cds trades and noticed the long call strikes are mostly ATM or even ITM (Please correct me if I’m wrong). But in your TSLA cds today, the long call strike was OTM. Was it because you analysed it to go ITM easily or simply because strike price didn’t matter for a cds?</p>

                <div>@kman, depends what you consider as a ‘loser’. You can be in a loss, and still be within your thesis for the trade. Correct? So, showing a negative P&amp;L does not necessarily mean you have a loss on your hands. If at all possible I never let trades become losers as per my thesis (and my execution into a trade needs to be keen) but when I do get stuck, I either manage them with options (which takes my focus off of my winners and the mkt and then I have to baby sit) or I just take the loss, which I would advise is the better coarse of action. I see that pretty much most trades responded to your q in kind.</div>

                <div>One thing I am noticing on Reddit is that people don’t seem to get the concept of “Paying Yourself” – If Day Trading is a job you need to pay yourself a salary, and that salary should be <i>consistent</i>&nbsp;and <i>dependable </i>.&nbsp; Obviously the higher your win rate and more predictable your profit is, the smaller the range of + or – each month you can expect.&nbsp; Some people take money out each week, others each month (I do each month) and leave the base in.&nbsp; Some stay at the same base all the time, and other reinvest some portion of the profits (I increase the base 15% every six month).&nbsp; But you need to treat it like a business with a business plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;And like a salary, having “bad months” is not an option when you need to pay the bills, which is why high probability trades and setups are key.&nbsp; I think sometimes we lose sight that this isn’t about 1 day or one good run, it is about a consistent income.</div>

For most traders it takes quite a while. Also switching to full time from part time when you have an income from a job really changes your mind set and if you were profitable before going full time there will likely be a time when you arent profitable after going full time so be prepared for that</p>

When you think a good trade is setting up you have to write down why and what your game plan is. entry/exit/stop. if you are honest with yourself it is an excellent exercise.

                <div>To me trading is about awareness. Great quarterbacks know how to read defenses, but for a second or two their back is turned to the field. When they turn around to throw they are able to analyze conditions in a split second. I feel trading is very similar because conditions are always changing.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Warsatan, you can only make yourself learn so much so fast, experience will have to pay its toll.&nbsp; It can be overwhelming, brain feel like mush, think that there are just too many variables to consider.. there are alot but dont over complicate things, keep on going and then they just all start to click. Ask questions and try not to develop bad habits. I highly recommend keeping a log on the trading day, trades, why you entered them, why they failed. etc.. My consistency has slowly increased overtime due to my not getting in every momentum mover that pops up, But looking at the long term trend and trading on the right side of that and the market intraday.</div>

                <p>A note about cds&nbsp; you arent necessarily looking for the stock price to stay below your short strike, many times it will move thru the short strike and you will still realize a nice profit. The cds is more about entering at less than 50% of the spread then if the stock price moves up you will book profits whether the short strike goes in the money or not. The short strike will still suffer larger time decay than the long strike gaining you a profit. If you think the price is going to go thru the short strike quickly then taking straight calls is a better trade but since we dont know that generally putting on a cds is about mitigating any loss in the event of a pullback or sideways move. In tese cases you can still ralize a profit on the cds when the straight calls would suffer a loss. I hope that gives you a better understanding of the logic behind choosing a cds</p>

                <div>the strike you sell (the 365 call in the example you cite) is the short strike since it is sold thus short.

                <div>When you buy a put you are long a put. Even though it is a bearish position, you are long a put. If you sell a put you are short a put. This is a bullish position.

When you sell a bullish put spread you are short a put spread. When you buy a put debit spread you are long a put spread. When you sell a bearish call spread you are short a call spread.

                <div>I think spreads are perhaps the most confusing for traders. The action you take on the closer to the money option determines if you are long or short the spread.

                <div>I know we are not big on fundamentals, but I do have a group that I do NOT like. Restaurants can be hurt on so many fronts. 1. Wages are rising and that is the biggest input cost 2. Food costs are rising and inflation is rising 3. Workers in many states are walking out and restaurants can’t find employees. 4. Delta variant is on the rise. Input costs will rise for sure and it is questionable to what extent consumers are willing to pay them. The walkouts and Delta are less of a concern, but could spark selling pressure. Just some thoughts on this group</div>

                <div>Another bad day for me. I made 3 trades and lost all of them. I jumped on PG and PEP at their hod early this morning, thinking they were piling up green candles with RS and they had nice D1. By the time, the market was not established yet so they were premature trades though, I’d like to ask if there is anything else from the stocks’ sides that could be seen as a sign that I shouldn’t jump on..&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@Steven</b>&nbsp;on PG you needed to wait for a pullback, another 2-3 minutes and you would have seen the double top and the loss of relative strength – if you waited 1:50pm you would have seen the increase in RS and the V formation.&nbsp; On PEP you entered after an engulfing drop and you needed to wait for the reversal which didn’t happen until the end of the day.&nbsp; So both were bad entries, but they also have great daily charts, so if you can’t hold them, then you are using too big of a position for your account size, you need to be able to comfortable hold these trades.</p>

                <p><b>@Steven</b>&nbsp;the main thing here is when you trade with a position size that is too high, you are restricted in your options on how to play it – the right play on those stocks is to take advantage of the strong Daily charts and the nice upward momentum they had at the end of the day – so you hold them.&nbsp; But you couldn’t because they would have taken up all your buying power and space in your account.</p>

                <div>Question: This question comes from a complete beginner, trading full-time approximately 3 months. I found that the 200, 100, and 50 day moving averages are not very useful on my intra-day charts (1 and 5 minute) as a trade entry point. What is everyone’s thoughts are having shorter times for the moving averages on the intra-day chart, such as 5 day moving average or 10 day moving average. Any general thoughts on moving averages would also be very helpful to a novice like myself.</div>

                <p><b>@oogwaypanda</b>&nbsp;so basically the 3 or 8 is time periods, right? And the EMA is exponential moving average, which means it is trended.&nbsp; So the 3 EMA is going to give you the average price over the last 3 time periods (if you are looking at 5 min chart, than it is the last 15 minutes) and the 8 is over the last 8 time periods (or 40 minutes on the 5 min chart) – Now, when the 3EMA line crosses above the 8 EMA line, it means that the most recent price action is higher than the previous price action, so the average price of the past 15 minutes is bigger than the average price of the past 40 minutes – that is a bullish trend, as the price is going up.</p>

                </div>
                <div>So when you see the line for 3 cross over on top of the 8, that is a good entry point.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now the 8EMA by itself is also a good indicator – if you see the price getting too extended away from that line, know that stocks tend to regress back towards it.&nbsp; If the price is very extended by the slope of the 8EMA matches the upward slope of the price, that is fine, but if the 8 EMA line is flat (let’s say) and the price is way up, you can expect some pull back.&nbsp; Make sense?</div>

                <p><b>@Hariseldon</b>&nbsp;This makes a lot of sense. So, when the 3 crosses over the 8 that is a good entry point because the most recent time period price increase is greater than the previous 8 time periods. Did I say that correct? Would it also be true that when the 3 crosses over the 8 that is an indication of oversold or does the 3/8 crossover have nothing to do with overbought and oversold indications?</p>

                <p><b>@Warsatan</b>&nbsp;I avoid trades like AMBA where the bid/ask is that wide. It is so hard to get in and out of the trade that it almost becomes a binary trade (max winner or max loser). That might seem fine if you think that the stock is going down longer term, but you will be frustrated when you can’t take your gains because the market makers will not trade in the middle. Sure you can lock in gains using the underlying stock, but that complicates the trade. Realize that you are trading against market makers. I suggest shorting the stock or looking for a better trade elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>@roman</b>&nbsp;before i joined this forum, a hard stop is how much I’m willing to lose per trade.&nbsp; I used a basis of 5%, 10% depending on the stock or options when i enter regardless what’s the chart telling me.&nbsp; It removed my guesswork but then i got kick out quite a bit just to see the play turned green again.&nbsp; I still use it but not a lot.&nbsp; I use it when i’m scalping options in 5-10 mins (move my stop up to the next candle to lock in profit).&nbsp; For general shares these days, i just watch the chart so i don’t get stop out by stop loss hunting (I’ve noticed at certain support/resistance for intraday, you’d see a long red/green candle with less volume than previous candles. and when that candle closes, there would be a long tail/top wick).&nbsp; &nbsp;My win/rate is still crap,&nbsp; just sharing what I’ve learned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <div>@roman here’s yet another answer to your question: to find your stop you’d need to know a) what is my thesis for this trade? b) how do I know if I’m wrong, and how much would I lose in that case? c) how much am I willing to pay to find out if my thesis is correct? The last one depends on your potential reward and conviction. I’d only take the trade if what it costs me to know that I’m wrong is less than the amount I’m willing to pay.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Let’s say I want to short NVDA right now. The daily chart looks very bearish. Ideally I’d find some resistance level above the price where if the price gets to I would know it’s not bearish anymore. The low of the July 8 candle is likely to be one, but it’s too far above. I’d be willing to pay half the red candle from yesterday to know if I’m wrong or not. That would place my stop at about 774. Someone else might have a higher tolerance and for instance use the 8ema as stop.&nbsp;</div>

                <p>Everyone: Instead of asking us to provide specific examples, why don’t you provide a specific trade example. State why you got in the trade and what your exit strategy was (stop, target and expected trade duration). I say this a million times a day. every stock is different and every market day is different. Often traders blame their exit strategy for their lack of success when actually it is the trade entry that is flawed. If you enter well with (LOTS OF CHECKBOXES MARKED) the stops are easy. When you enter a choppy stock and the trade is ill-conceived (no market tailwind or game plan) you are doomed from the start. Yesterday you saw me stop out of some SPY trades just because the move did not happen in the predetermined time I had established. You provide the specifics (get detailed) and we will take a look. Please post annotated charts with your game plan.&nbsp;</p>

<div>hey @PaulC i have been meaning to ask you a wash sales question since the last time you mentioned few things here….i have been unable to find anyone talking about how averaging down affects wash sales during the december/january window. I understand outside of it that it simply adjusts the cost basis and it is not something worry about. But due to FIFO, is that something you keep in mind when trading on non-trader status?</div>

                <div>moo?&nbsp; I saw you reposed Patrick’s question…&nbsp; I think I answered above…FIFO is default unless you enact another method.&nbsp; (BTW, your broker typically setting is by FIFO usually, but if you are concerned check with how they handle sales/lots/etc)&nbsp; Each transaction is impacted by prior and it’s kind of a running ledger (+5 shares, +3 shares, -6 shares, whatever) and the gains/losses…software and knowledge are your only way to piece it together</div>

                <div>@RichardU @Shark – As mentioned, you don’t really “claim” trader status by checking a box or on a form.&nbsp; Essentially you “earn” it (and thereby assert/claim you are a trader essentially).&nbsp; There’s trader status in the IRC (Tax code –&gt; see publication 550 for a start from IRS side) and there’s a ton of case law on it.&nbsp; Robert Green (among others) does a great job of explaining what the criteria are… (super over simplified) –&gt; 1) You must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation (e.g., don’t hold for 9 months or 9 years and collect dividends as your main income generation along with some capital appreciation)…2)&nbsp;<span style="">Your activity must be substantial…3)&nbsp;</span></div>

                <p>There’s huge interpretation to much of this.  Many say trade at least 75% of the market days (around 180 days) and have ~4-6 trades a day (2 opens and 2 closes for total of 4..doesn’t have to be day trade, but ~4-6 overall a day..can’t just have like 1M trades for 10 days a year…that’s not gonna cut it).  These are all just guidelines as there are no absolute specifics but rather interpretations from tax court cases.  Having the right representation (a CPA who knows this stuff) for this is critical if you are making money and probably even more so if you are losing money (otherwise you are subject to potentially just $3k per year loss limitations which doesn’t help much on a large $20k or $200k annual loss as an “investor” instead of a “trader”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>BTW, you can still be treated as a “sole proprietor” type of taxpayer for 2021 and have “trader” status (assuming you meet the criteria) but you just can’t elect Mark to market (section 475) for 2021 anymore as it’s past May deadline this year (usually April).  If you form a legal entity in 2021 (e.g., an LLC or LLC with an S-corp election) then you get 75 days…Legal entity selection, cost/benefit/etc., is a big deal as while some folks absolutely should be in an entity, which type/why/etc., some probably don’t need to outlay the expense, effort.  You don’t have to have mark to market elected to be in the business of trading (“trader” status)  but you do need to have trader status to probably benefit from various tax business benefits.  Hope this helps…there’s tons of info online about this stuff.  I’d go with the 2 folks I mentioned for further research.  Many others will gloss over things or oversimplify for clickbait or quick fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                </div>
                <div>General rule on BPS – this is just the math of it, but everyone can do their own risk tolerance.&nbsp; There are two numbers that matter – what is your likelihood of success and what is your ROI?&nbsp; So if for example you have a ROI of 10% on a $5 spread, that means when you win, you are getting .50 and when you lose you are losing 4.50, you would need a win percent of higher than 90% for that spread to be profitable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now the farther you go out from the ATM strike, the lower the credit you will receive, thus the lower your ROI and the higher your win percentage needs to be, but also the higher your chance of success is (since the stock would have to drop a lot to break the spread) – so the question is then – well why not just go really far out?&nbsp; Because let’s say you go so far out and get a 10 cent, which is a 2% ROI on a $5 spread, you would need 10 contracts just to make $100, BUT it still requires $490 of margin to hold each contract, so you are tying up $4900 to make $100.&nbsp; Plus, the 2% of time it doesn’t come in, you are losing $4,900 per 10 contracts.&nbsp; Again doesn’t make sense.&nbsp; So what is the sweet spot?</div>

                </div>
                <div>What we have found here is that the sweet spot is roughly 25% ROI.&nbsp; Which is 10 cents credit for every 50 cents in the spread between strikes.&nbsp; And that if you choose really strong stocks with solid levels of support above the short strike, your odds of success exceed the 75% win rate needed to break even.&nbsp; Thus, that is why it is always recommended to get 20 cents for every $1 in a spread on an OTM BPS’</div>

The&nbsp;<span style="">IWM (etf tracking small caps Russell2000 index) is closing on the 100ma. This week it has already breached below its 1-week expected move (1 standard deviation) to the downside, now for the second week in a row. Since May, it has breached its weekly expected move to the downside in four weeks out of 12 weeks. In the same period the QQQ SPY have breached downside of weekly expected move 0 times. This tells me that the underbelly is very very soft and prone to fits of accelerated downside (i.e. breaching the 1SD move)</span></div>

                <div>Options skew: there is strong inverse call/put pricing skew right now on SPY and many stocks. the calls are more expensive than puts, e.g. an atm cds on SPY is .60 for the call side but .40 for the put side pds. typically this is supposed to be opposite, i.e. the put side should cost more and call side should cost less. so in this inverse skew market, the bearish side of options have more bang for your buck as option buyer via pds (you can get a $1 for .40) or more premium for your bp as via call credit spread as there is more premium to collect in them. Inversely, this is a very very poor market for selling put credit spreads, and also very expensive to buy atm call cebit spreads&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Buying protective puts sucks when the market keeps going higher. Asset Mgrs look at it as wasted money when the puts keep expiring worthless. Eventually they stop buying the puts. A very low VIX also indicates a low level of protection. That is one reason why the market dropped so much in 2020</div>

                <div>@hari thanks and yes, i understand that … I think what i’m missing is the calculation of how much something will go up… and where max profit and 50pop matter. For instance … if I buy a CDS for say $1500 and $1400 and I pay $100 …. 50% of that is 50 bucks … but for it to get to that $50 it has to go far beyond my sold call i’m guessing because of IV … and I can’t calculate or predict that can i? When I first started I thought if I bought a 100 strike and sold a 105 strike when the price hit 102.50 I’d get 50% of max profit … but that is totally not correct and I still haven’t figured out how to best utilize them.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Danette, if you are bullish on the stock and it has a favorable technical setup you will tie up less capital and get higher returns on capital with less stress using call debit spreads vs just being long the stock.&nbsp; The stock needs to have decent option liquidity and you need to buy the spread at less than 50% of the spread of the strikes, preferably less than 30% if you can.&nbsp; Time decay works in your favor on the short strike because it decays faster than the long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                <div>agree with brent, i trade stocks over 200 a majority of the time, and as much as i like the lazer entry and exit from stock, using cds can be just as effective if the options carry good liquidity.

                <div>Remember – with spreads it is all about how much your are paying/getting and what the probability needed is to be profitable.&nbsp; Say you are doing a Bullish Put Spread – and you do 235/230 on MRNA, expires this Friday – and you get a credit of $2.&nbsp; If MRNA finishes above 235 on Friday you get full credit.&nbsp; With a $2 credit you need to be successful 60% of the time to break even (6 times out of time you get $2 = $12, 4 times out of time you lose $3 = $12).&nbsp; Then the question becomes, does MRNA have a higher than 60% chance of going above 235?&nbsp; The higher the credit you receive, the lower your win rate needs to be for it become a profitable play.&nbsp; With a Call Debit Spread, as long as your debit is always less than half of the distance between strikes, your max loss will always be lower than your max profit.&nbsp; This eases the burden on the win rate as well.</div>

                <div>you are correct on the above regarding 40 contracts.&nbsp; But I’d recommend you start with a smaller number of contracts first and try it, collect your statistics on win/loss ratio over 20 trades, % gains on winners, % gains on losers.&nbsp; also really important to know your largest winner and largest loser percents.&nbsp; Then you know within a range of probability from your historic performance what to expect from your trading and if you do this it will build your confidence in the strategy and will then allow you to confidently size up when appropriate.&nbsp; Think always in terms of risk first, how much can I lose if I’m wrong, what will I do if I’m wrong, what’s my maximum loss I will take and the money will come.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

                <div>However BPS’ are easier to leg out of (well they aren’t easy, but <i>easier) </i>than CDS’, because in a BPS’, you can buy back the short strike and let the long put run until you hit max profit if the stock weakens as well as the market. With a CDS, if you buy back the option that is hurting you (the long call) you are left with the short calls which 1) eat up your margin and 2) are very dangerous to have naked.&nbsp; So there are pros and cons, but overall if you are bullish on a stock, and it meets the criteria, a Call Debit Spread is going to be the better short term alternative, and an OTM Bullish Put Spread with a 25% ROI and several layers of support above the short strike is going to be the better long term candidate.</div>

                <p><b>@Danette</b>&nbsp;Think about legging out like this – say you have a 305/300 BPS – when you got it you received a $2.10 credit for selling the 305 Puts and spent $1.10 for the 300 long Puts, and now it’s in trouble – with 4 days left the stock is at 302, it’s broken through major support levels and dropping. &nbsp;You can either A) close the spread for a loss, B) hold on to it and see if it turns around or C) Leg Out. &nbsp;If you leg out, the stock has to be Relatively Weak (which it most likely is given that it broke support) and the market needs to be weak as well.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The reason is that you are closing the short puts (305), let’s say in this example they are $7.50 each. When you first sold them they were $3.10, so now you’re down $4.40, which sucks.  Now you’re left with just good ole fashioned Puts with a strike of 300, and they’re worth $3 – in order to reach max profit those puts need to be worth the same amount you spent to close the short puts ($7.50).   Which means the stock has to keep dropping (another $5 or so).  The higher in value those 300 strike puts are, the less money you lose.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>also experts talk about where the cross happens (how deep in the opposite territory — for example, if a bullish cross happens deep in negative territory, it may indicate a stronger bullish move — but always wait for confirmation, since there might be a divergence)</div>

                <div>I think it helps to think of it as buying and selling pressure (though of course, only Pete knows the underlying). The deeper the cross, the stronger the indicator. As Patrick mentioned, despite a cross, wait for confirmation always. For example, if the market is flat despite a bearish cross… that means that the bears have exerted more force than the bulls, but have been unable to achieve any results. As a result, the next bullish cross will likely have a strong impact on SPY.</div>

                <div>I was just thinking of an analogy for 1OP. Think of a game of Tug-of-war between the Bulls and the Bears. There is force exerted on both directions, but if you’ve ever played it… you know it’s not constant. One team might hold static for a bit, then heave together for a strong pull. 1OP shows how much energy is being spent by each team, relative to the other. SPY is the live scoreboard, showing how much and in which direction the rope is moving. If Team Bull is pulling harder than Team Bear (1OP trending upwards), then you would expect the rope to move in their direction (SPY to move upwards). If Team Bear overpower and begin pulling harder than Team Bull, then we would expect the direction of the rope movement to change (1OP bearish cross, and SPY to move downwards).</div>

                </div>
                <p>Now imagine if Team Bull was made of strongmen and Team Bear was made of middle schoolers. If Team Bear was trying its hardest and Team Bull was just daintly holding the rope while sipping on beers, you’d expect a lot of energy spent from one side and little movement in the rope. This would be the equivalent of a bearish divergence, where 1OP is dipping (bears are trying hard), but the market is not moving or even moving upwards. Therefore, you would know that in this match, when the Team Bull eventually decide to start trying, it’s going to really fly.</p>

                <p><b>@JF</b>&nbsp;a few things – I want to make sure I am not a victim of stop-hunting, like on BTU, I had my mental stop constantly moving up based on the low of the previous candle, however, twice BTU jumped down to that price, before rebounding up within less than a second – if those were hard stops I would have been out of the trade.&nbsp; Another reason, if you look at GROM, I bought in at 4.03, GROM dropped to 3.7 – a hard stop would have taken that out, but what I wanted to see on GROM was – are the red candles on volume bigger than the green?&nbsp; They weren’t so I said in, it just meant that sellers were not very committed but they were able to drop the price – a hard stop is set before I can see that happening.</p>

                <div>When your stops are based on a formula you are trading your P&amp;L by default.&nbsp; &nbsp;Share size?&nbsp; I have full size, half size, quarter size and scale in size.&nbsp; And that is different based on the price of the stock.&nbsp; So for GROM, full size would be let’s say, 50,000 shares – but scaling in, I would start with 5,000 and work it up.&nbsp; It depends – like with BIDU, I was shorting it against the market, so I did not do full size on that, I did quarter size, and then added later to half size, as I am still shorting against the market.&nbsp; BUT I also made this calculator here that can tell you what your share size should be based on your stats on stop point:&nbsp;</div>

                <div>Ok, So also know that the support level is more like a “zone” and some room should given. “I respect that style of, this is what i want if not im out.” When I say re evaluate at that level instead of hard stop so you can watch the price aciton, is the Stock coming in on decreasing volume? Is it holding a pattern, did it come in on its own or is the market selling off? is the set up still valid? Where you have your stop may be exactly where it deiced to bounce. I suggest until you get a good feel on reading price action and volume, trade less size expand stop zone on stocks with good daily set ups.</div>

                <div>Mechanically they limit your upside and dont protect the downside. They protect the sideways only. Stock rallies sharply and you’ve missed out on an outlier move to the upside. Stock plummets and you get an insignificant buffer, especially in growth tech stocks. With Vix &lt; 20 and natural put/call skew, the premium in short calls is negligible unless you're ATM.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>So when to use them? Imo never. Calendar spreads are far more capital efficient ways to collect premium in sideways but grind-upwards assets such as SPY or even blue chips like MSFT.&nbsp;</div>

                <p><b>@Brian</b>&nbsp;directional bps was my bread &amp; butter in 2020 and i have since switched entirely for collecting premium to this strategy of low delta short puts on index. The directional rotations every day are killer for swing trades even using bps, as the low IV gives no buffer from the bps mechanic like in 2020 IV levels. The rotations however are great for day trades, and also great for keeping the indices floating higher so collecting premium on the index is viable. It’s not optimal with vix this low, and that mechanic is combated with time.&nbsp;</p>

                <div>Here is the issue with Covered Calls – the only time the premium you receive is worth it in exchange for the upside you lose is when the IV is high – however, when the IV is high it is because market makers are assuming a wide ATR on the stock, meaning, the odds of the stocks exceeding your CC is significantly higher, so you get more premium but in exchange lose more upside.&nbsp; Now look at a Butterfly on AAPL, same strike, sell 2 145 calls, buy 1 140 call and 1 150 call – it is 1.50 debit, with a 3.50 max profit.&nbsp;</div>

                <div>But like this past week, I was very bullish on NVDA on Friday, but did not want to use calls as theta would have killed me – so I did a 825/827.50 ITM BPS, for a 2.75 credit (a trade Dave said he would have done if he wasn’t on vacation), which had time decay working for me.&nbsp; I was able to take profit on that today and safely take advantage of the bullish trend in the stock.</div>

                <div>As for scalps or non-scalps, the way I see it, this room has a foundation of trading on the strength or weakness of stock vs. the market (&nbsp;<span class="caps">SPY</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;) , in which OptionStalker has searches, scans and indicators (1OSI) for, and we also have an edge in the using the 1OP to anticipate the direction of&nbsp;<span class="caps" style="">SPY</span><span style="">&nbsp;.&nbsp; Every trade conforms to that ( or should ) with one exception – Momentum trades – they do not require RS/RW (they may have it for 1 bar, but rarely over 10 periods like the 10SI measures) – and are more dependent on volume, catalyst, and candlestick patterns – those trades are different from RS/RW – some last 10 seconds and are a true “scalp”, while other can last longer, but I think all momentum trades are “scalps” in the context of this room.&nbsp; Agree?</span></div>

Line in the sand 175.86. This happens to be a ath b/o but if it wasn’t i would normally have a tgt for 1/2 at 46% retracement to the next level and let the other half ride to full tgt or leg out as it comes in to re test the b/o. level. This can all change as i am in the trade watching price action. Most the time i build in to a position and add as it confirms. This could break out and go for ever, or pee and turn back around as rejection. How would you list this trade?&nbsp;<span class="caps">HSY</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;175.86 or&nbsp;<span class="caps">HSY S</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;175.86?</div>

                <p><b>@Shark</b>&nbsp;that is just HSY 175.86 if it has RS, if it doesn’t it wouldn’t qualify as a posted traded, as it is neither momentum based or RS based.&nbsp; Because if it is breaking out without Relative Strength, it means by default the market is very strong and dragging every stock with it, including HSY, which means it can quickly reverse without that Relative Strength.</p>
